women are, in fact, so much degraded by mistaken notions of female excellence, that i do not mean to add a paradox when i assert, that this artificial weakness produces a propensity to tyrannize, and gives birth to cunning, the natural opponent of strength, which leads them to play off those contemptible infantine airs that undermine esteem even whilst they excite desire. [let men become more chaste and modest, and if women do not grow wiser in the same ratio, it will be clear that they have weaker understandings]. it seems scarcely necessary to say, that i now speak of the sex in general. many individuals have more / sense than their male relatives; and, as nothing preponderates where there is a constant struggle for an equilibrium, without it has naturally more gravity, some women govern their husbands without degrading themselves, because intellect will always govern. /
