multitude had rushed into the different theatres, at the hour of opening them, and required, that they should be instantly shut; and that in consequence all the spectators had been sent away:  a third announced four cannons, placed at the entrance of the champs elyses, with their cannoneers ready to light their matches, which were to begin the combat; and that these four cannons were supported by a regiment of cavalry, which, advancing under the command of the prince de lambesca to the place of louis th, was stationed by the bridge that leads to the thuilleries. he added also, that a cavalier of this regiment, passing by a soldier of the french guards, had fired his pistol at him; and, that the prince de lambesc himself had galloped into the garden, sabre in hand, followed by a detachment, who put to flight the old men, women, and children, that were peaceably taking their customary walk; nay, that he had actually killed, with his own hand, an old man, who was escaping from the tumult. the reporter, it is true, forgot / to notice, that the populace had begun to pelt the prince with the stones, that were lying ready, near the buildings which were not finished. startled, perhaps, by this resistance, and despising the mob, that he expected, only by his presence, to have intimidated, in a delirium, most probably, of terrour and astonishment, he wounded an unarmed man, who fled before him. be that as it may, this wanton outrage excited the indignation necessary to fire every spirit.
