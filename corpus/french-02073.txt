'who can avoid being affected by such examples? what a moment to display our resources, to invoke the aid of every corner of the empire!  o prevent the shame, with which the violation of our engagements, our most sacred engagements, would stain the birth of freedom! prevent those dreadful shocks, which, in overturning the most solid institutions, and shattering the most established fortunes, would leave france covered with the sad ruins of a shameful hurricane. how mistaken are those, who at a certain distance from the capital contemplate not the links, which connect public faith with national prosperity, and with the social contract! / they who pronounce the infamous term bankruptcy, are they not rather a herd of ferocious beasts, than a society of men just and free? where is the frenchman who will dare to look his fellow citizens in the face, when his conscience shall upbraid him with having contributed to empoison the existence of millions of his fellow creatures? are we the nation to whose honour it's enemies bear witness, who are about to sully the proud distinction by a bankruptcy?  shall we give them cause to say, we have only recovered our liberty and strength to commit, without shuddering, crimes which paled even the cheek of despotism?
