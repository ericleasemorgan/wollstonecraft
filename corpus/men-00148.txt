this fear of god makes me reverence myself.  yes, sir, the regard i have for honest fame, and the friendship of the virtuous, falls far short of the respect which i have for myself. and this, enlightened self-love, if an epithet the meaning of which has been grossly perverted will convey my idea, forces me to see; and, if i may venture to borrow a prostituted term, to feel, that happiness is reflected, and that, in communicating good, my soul receives its noble aliment.  i do not trouble myself, therefore, to enquire whether this is the fear the people of england feel:  / and, if it be natural to include all the modifications which you have annexed  it is not.
