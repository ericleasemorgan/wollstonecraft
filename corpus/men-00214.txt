in order that liberty should have a firm foundation, an acquaintance with the world would naturally lead cool men to conclude that it must be laid, knowing the weakness of the human heart, and the 'deceitfulness of riches,'c either by poor men, or philosophers, if a sufficient number of men, disinterested from principle, or truly wise, could be found. was it natural to expect that sensual prejudices should give way to reason, or present feelings to enlarged views?  no; i am afraid that human nature is still in such a weak state, that the abolition of titles, the corner-stone of / despotism, could only have been the work of men who had no titles to sacrifice. the national assembly, it is true, contains some honourable exceptions;d but the majority had not such powerful feelings to struggle with, when reason led them to respect the naked dignity of virtue.
