here an awful stop is put to our inquiries.  but, why should i conceal my sentiments? considering the attributes of god, i believe that whatever punishment may follow, will tend, like the anguish of disease, to shew the malignity of vice, for the purpose of reformation. positive punishment appears so contrary to the nature of god, discoverable in all his works, and in our own reason, that i could sooner believe that the deity paid no attention to the conduct of men, than that he punished without the benevolent design of reforming.
