yet this remonstrance, so well calculated to preserve the dignity of the monarch, and appease the agitation of the public, produced no other effect than a supercilious answer, that only tended to increase the want of confidence, to which disgust gave a new edge. for, instead of attending to the prayer of the nation, the king asserted, that the tumultuous and scandalous scenes, which had passed at paris, and at versailles, under his own eyes, and those of the national assembly, were sufficient to induce him, one of whose principal duties it was to watch over the public safety, to station troops round paris.  still, he declared, that, far from intending to interrupt their freedom of debate, he only wished to preserve them even from all apprehension of tumult and violence. if, however, / the necessary presence of the troops continued to give umbrage, he was willing, at the request of the assembly, to transfer the states-general to noyon or soissons; and to repair himself to compigne,a in order to maintain the requisite intercourse with the assembly.b this answer signified nothing; or, rather, it formally announced, that the king would not send away the troops. obvious as was the meaning, and contemptible as was the dissimulation; yet, as it came from the sovereign, the fountain of fortune and honours, some of the supple hands of the deputies applauded.  but, mirabeau was not to be cajoled by such shallow fallacy.
