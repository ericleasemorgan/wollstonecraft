i observed that it was not mechanical, because a whole was produced  a model of that grand simplicity, of those concurring energies, which arrest our attention and command our reverence. for only insipid lifeless beauty is produced by a servile copy of even beautiful nature. yet, independent of these observations, i believe that the human form must have been far more beautiful than it is at present, because extreme indolence, barbarous ligatures, and many causes, which forcibly act on it, in our luxurious state of society, did not retard its expansion, or render it deformed. exercise and cleanliness appear to be not only the surest means of preserving health, but of promoting beauty, the physical causes only considered; yet, this is not sufficient, moral ones must concur, or beauty will be merely of that rustic kind which blooms on the innocent, wholesome, countenances of some country people, whose minds have not been exercised. to render the person perfect, physical and moral beauty ought to be attained / at the same time; each lending and receiving force by the combination. judgment must reside on the brow, affection and fancy beam in the eye, and humanity curve the cheek, or vain is the sparkling of the finest eye or the elegantly turned finish of the fairest features: whilst in every motion that displays the active limbs and well-knit joints, grace and modesty should appear. but this fair assemblange is not to be brought together by chance; it is the reward of exertions [calculated] to support each other; for judgment can only be acquired by reflection, affection by the discharge of duties, and humanity by the exercise of compassion to every living creature.
