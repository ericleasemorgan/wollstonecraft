'my children,' replied the king, 'you wish me to be at paris, and i will go; but it is on the condition, that my wife and family accompany me.'a a loud shout of vive le roi testified the extacy of the moment. the king made a sign to demand silence; and then, / with tears in his eyes addressed them again.  'ah! my children, run to the relief of my guards.'b immediately two or three appeared in the balcony with the national cockade in their hats, or the cap of liberty on their heads. the king threw his arms round one of them, and the people following his example embraced those whom they had taken prisoners in the court. one sentiment of gladness seemed to animate the whole concourse of people; and their sensibility produced as mad demonstrations of joy as lately had been displayed of ferocity. the soldiery all mingled together, exchanging swords, hats, or shoulder belts  exhibiting in the most striking manner the prominent features of the french character.
