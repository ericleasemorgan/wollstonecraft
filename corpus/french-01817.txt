these disorders, warmly represented by lally-tolendal,a determined the assembly, on the d of july, to publish a proclamation, inviting all good citizens to the maintenance of order; and declaring, that to try and punish for all crimes of leze-nationb was the sole prerogative of the national assembly, till, by the constitution which it was about to establish, a regular tribunal should be instituted, for the trial of such offences. after endeavouring to excuse the violence, or, more properly speaking, to account for it, mirabeau observed to the assembly, 'that they ought to be thoroughly convinced, that the continuation of this formidable dictator would expose liberty / to as much risk as the stratagems of her enemies. society,' he continues, 'would soon be dissolved, if the multitude, accustomed to blood and disorder, placed themselves above the magistrates, and braved the authority of the law. instead of running to meet freedom, the people would soon throw themselves into the abyss of servitude; for danger too often rallies men round the standard of absolute power; and in the bosom of anarchy, a despot even appears a saviour. for carthage is not yet destroyed; there remains a mass of instruments to impede our operations, and to excite divisions in an assembly, that has only been united by danger.'c
