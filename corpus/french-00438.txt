weeping  scarcely conscious that i weep, o france! over the vestiges of thy former oppression; which, separating man from man with a fence of iron, sophisticated all, and made many completely wretched; i tremble, lest i should meet some unfortunate being, fleeing from the despotism of licentious freedom, hearing the snap of the guillotine at his heels; merely because he was once noble, or has afforded an asylum to those, whose only crime is their name  and, if my pen almost bound with eagerness to record the day, that levelled the bastille with the dust, making the towers of despair tremble to their base; the recollection, that still the abbey is appropriated to hold the victims of revenge and suspicion, palsies the hand that would fain do justice to the assault, which tumbled into heaps of ruins walls that seemed to mock the resistless force of time.  down fell the temple of despotism; but  despotism has not been buried in it's ruins!  unhappy country!  when will thy children cease to tear thy bosom?  when will a change of opinion, producing a change of morals, render thee truly free?  / when will truth give life to real magnanimity, and justice place equality on a stable seat?  when will thy sons trust, because they deserve to be trusted; and private virtue become the guarantee of patriotism? ah!  when will thy government become the most perfect, because thy citizens are the most virtuous!/
