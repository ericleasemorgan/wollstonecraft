i come round to my old argument; if woman be allowed to have an immortal soul, she must have, as the employment of life, an understanding to improve. and when, to render the present state more complete, though every thing proves it to be but a fraction of a mighty sum, she is incited by present gratification to forget her grand destination, / [nature] is counteracted, or she was born only to procreate and rot. or, granting brutes, of every description, a soul, though not a reasonable one, the exercise of instinct and sensibility may be the step, which they are to take, in this life, towards the attainment of reason in the next; so that through all eternity they will lag behind man, who, why we cannot tell, had the power given him of attaining reason in his first mode of existence.
