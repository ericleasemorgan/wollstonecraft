and he, adhering to his purpose, left versailles the next day (the th), though his family ridiculously endeavoured to dissuade him; insinuating, that he ought not to trust / his sacred person to the mercy of an enraged multitude; whilst rumours of projected assassinations were repeated before him, with exaggerated comments. but, being a man of considerable animal courage, and now almost perceiving, that all the evils with which he was struggling had been produced by his headstrong advisers, he seemed determined, at least for the present, not to be governed by their dangerous councils. and he had even the sagacity to foresee, that, convulsed as the kingdom was, they would occasion a civil war, and his life might then be still more exposed. in this instance, as we shall find in many others, louis appears to have been directed by a kind of glimmering instinct of propriety; for at the present juncture it was particularly discreet, considering the little effect the pageantry of the court had produced at the sance royale, to meet the people without the parade of robes or guards. and, in fact, the hundred deputies who followed him, were now the only retinue that would have appeared respectable in the eyes of the people. what too must have been his surprise, in spite of all he had heard, to pass through an immense avenue of armed parisians with such / a new aspect.  till now he had always seen a timid multitude flying before the watch, giving vent to their vengeance in vain songs, and to their grief in feeble murmurs:  to-day he saw them triumphant, moving orderly along, calling out on every side, during the procession, for a constitution and laws! marching in unison with their reflections, they advanced, but slowly; for, almost afraid to hope, they proceeded with the measured step of thought, or rather sadness; and the people, whose mind was still agitated, as the swell of the sea continues after the storm has subsided, uttered not the shout of gladness  vive le roi;  but the menacing memento  vive la nation.
