a truly benevolent legislator always endeavours to make it the interest of each individual to be virtuous; and thus private virtue becoming the cement of public happiness, an orderly whole is consolidated by the tendency of all the parts towards a common centre. but, the private or public virtue of woman is very problematical; for rousseau, and a numerous list of male writers, insist that she should all her life be subjected to a severe restraint, that of propriety. why subject her to propriety  blind propriety, if she be capable of acting from a nobler spring, if she be an heir of immortality? is sugar always to be produced by vital blood? is one half of the human species, like the poor african slaves, to be subject to prejudices that brutalize them, when principles would be a surer guard, only to sweeten the cup of man? is not this indirectly to deny woman reason? for a gift is a mockery, if it be unfit for use.
