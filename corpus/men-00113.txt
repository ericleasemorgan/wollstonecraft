the sight of august ruins, of a depopulated country  what are they to a disordered soul! / when all the faculties are mixed in wild confusion. it is then indeed we tremble for humanity  and, if some wild fancy chance to cross the brain, we fearfully start, and pressing our hand against our brow, ask if we are yet men?  if our reason is undisturbed?  if judgment hold the helm? marius might sit with dignity on the ruins of carthage,a and the wretch in the bastille, who longed in vain to see the human face divine, might yet view the operations of his own mind, and vary the leaden prospect by new combinations of thought: poverty, shame, and even slavery, may be endured by the virtuous man  he has still a world to range in  but the loss of reason appears a monstrous flaw in the moral world, that eludes all investigation, and humbles without enlightening.
