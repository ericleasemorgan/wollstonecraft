my imagination darts forward with benevolent fervour to greet these amiable and respectable groups, in spite of the sneering of cold hearts, who are at liberty to utter, with frigid self-importance, the damning epithet  romantic; the force of which i shall endeavour to blunt by repeating the words of an eloquent moralist.  'i know not whether the allusions of a truly humane heart, whose zeal renders every thing easy, [be] not preferable to that rough and repulsing reason, which always finds an indifference for the public good, the first obstacle to whatever would promote it.'
