i carry this sentiment still further. affection, when love is out of the question, authorises many personal endearments, that naturally flowing from an innocent heart, give life to the behaviour; but the personal intercourse of appetite, gallantry, or vanity, is despicable. when a man squeezes the hand of a pretty woman, handing her to a carriage, whom he has never seen before, she will consider such an impertinent freedom in the light of an insult, if she have any true delicacy, instead of being flattered by this unmeaning homage to beauty. these are the privileges of friendship, or the momentary homage which the heart pays to virtue, when / it flashes suddenly on the notice  mere animal spirits have no claim to the kindnesses of affection!
