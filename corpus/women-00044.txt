 into what inconsistencies do men fall when they argue without the compass of principles. women, weak women, are compared with angels; yet, a superiour order of beings should be supposed to possess more intellect than man; or, in what does their superiority consist? in the same strain, to drop the sneer, they are allowed to possess more goodness of heart, piety, and benevolence.  i doubt the fact, though it be courteously brought forward, unless ignorance be allowed to be the mother of devotion; for i am firmly persuaded that, on an average, the proportion between virtue and knowledge, is more upon a par than is commonly granted.
