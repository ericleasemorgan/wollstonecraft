the foundation of liberty was laid in the declaration of rights; the first three articles of which contain the great principles of natural, political, and civil liberty.  first, that men are born, and always continue, free, and equal in respect to their rights:  civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility. secondly, the end of all political associations is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man: which rights are  liberty, property, security, and resistance of oppression. thirdly, the nation is the / source of all sovereignty: no body of men, no individual, can then be entitled to any authority, which is not derived from it. the first article, establishing the equality of man, strikes at the root of all useless distinctions:  the second, securing his rights against oppression, maintains his dignity: and the third, acknowledging the sovereignty of the nation, confirms the authority of the people.  these are the essential points of a good government: and it is only necessary, when these points are ascertained by a nation, and solemnly ratified in the hearts of it's citizens, to take care, in the formation of a political system, to provide against the abuse of the executive part; whilst equal caution should be observed, not to destroy it's efficiency, as on that depend it's justice, vigour, and promptitude. the other articles are explanatory of the nature and intent of these rights, and ought to have had more attention paid to them, when the structure was raised, to which they served as a basis.
