thus a frenchman, like most women, may be said to have no character distinguishable from that of the nation; unless little shades, / and casual lights, be allowed to constitute an essential characteristic. what then could have been expected, when their ambition was mostly confined to dancing gracefully, entering a room with easy assurance, and smiling on and complimenting the very persons whom they meant to ridicule at the next fashionable assembly? the learning to fence with skill, it is true, was useful to a people, whose false notions of honour required that at least a drop of blood should atone for the shadow of an affront. the knack also of uttering sprightly repartees became a necessary art, to supply the place of that real interest only to be nourished in the affectionate intercourse of domestic intimacy, where confidence enlarges the heart it opens. besides, the desire of eating dish at table, no matter if there were fifty, and the custom of separating immediately after the repast, destroy the social affections, reminding a stranger of the vulgar saying  'every man for himself, and god for us all.'a after these cursory observations, it is not going too far to advance, that the french were in some respects the most unqualified of any people / in europe to undertake the important work in which they are embarked.
