before i conclude my cursory remarks, it is but just to acknowledge that i coincide with you in your opinion respecting the sincerity of many modern philosophers.b your consistency in avowing a veneration for rank and riches deserves praise; but i must own that i have often indignantly observed that some of the enlightened philosophers, who talk most vehemently of the native rights of men, borrow many noble sentiments to adorn their conversation, which have no influence on their conduct. they bow down to rank, and are careful to secure property; for virtue, without this adventitious drapery, is seldom very respectable in their eyes  nor are they very quick-sighted to discern real dignity of character when no sounding name exalts the man above his elbows.  but neither open enmity / nor hollow homage destroys the intrinsic value of those principles which rest on an eternal foundation, and revert for a standard to the immutable attributes of god.
