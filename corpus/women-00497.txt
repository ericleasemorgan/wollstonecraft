a king is always a king  and a woman always a woman: his authority and her sex, ever stand between them and rational converse. with a lover, i grant, she should be so, and her sensibility will naturally lead her to endeavour to excite emotion, not to gratify / her vanity, but her heart. this i do not allow to be coquetry, it is the artless impulse of nature, i only exclaim against the sexual desire of conquest when the heart is out of the question.
