but, as the whole system of representation is now, in this country, only a convenient handle for despotism, they need not complain, for they are as well represented as a numerous class of hard working mechanics, who pay for the support of royalty when they can scarcely stop their children's mouths with bread. how are they represented whose very / sweat supports the splendid stud of an heir apparent, or varnishes the chariot of some female favourite who looks down on shame? taxes on the very necessaries of life, enable an endless tribe of idle princes and princesses to pass with stupid pomp before a gaping crowd, who almost worship the very parade which costs them so dear. this is mere gothic grandeur, something like the barbarous useless parade of having sentinels on horseback at whitehall, which i could never view without a mixture of contempt and indignation.
