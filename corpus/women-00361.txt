i own it frequently happens that women who have fostered a romantic unnatural delicacy of feeling, waste their lives in imagining how happy they should have been with a husband who could love them with a fervid increasing affection every day, and all day. but they might as well pine married as single  and would not be a jot more unhappy with a bad husband than longing for a good one. that a proper education; or, to speak with more precision, a well stored mind, would enable a woman to support a single life with dignity, i grant; but that she should avoid cultivating her taste, lest her husband should occasionally shock it, is quitting a substance for a shadow. to say the truth, i do not know of what use is an improved taste, if / the individual be not rendered more independent of the casualties of life; if new sources of enjoyment, only dependent on the solitary operations of the mind, are not opened. people of taste, married or single, without distinction, will ever be disgusted by various things that touch not less observing minds. on this conclusion the argument must not be allowed to hinge; but in the whole sum of enjoyment is taste to be denominated a blessing?
