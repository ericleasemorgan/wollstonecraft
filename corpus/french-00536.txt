if at one epocha of civilization we know, that all the improvements which were made in arts and sciences were suddenly overturned, both in greece and rome, we need not inquire, / why superficial reasoners have been induced to think, that there is only a certain degree of civilization to which men are capable of attaining, without receding back to a state of barbarism, by the horrid consequences of anarchy; though it may be necessary to observe, that the causes which produced that event can never have the same effect again:  because a degree of knowledge has been diffused through society by the invention of printing, which no inundation of barbarians can eradicate. besides, the improvement of governments do not now depend on the genius of particular men; but on the impetus given to the whole society by the discovery of useful truths. the opposers then of popular governments may tell us, if they please, that themistocles had no motive in saving his country, but to gratify his ambition; that cicero was vain, and brutus only envious of the growing greatness of caesar.a  or, to approach our own times;  that, if the supercilious wedderburneb had not offered an indignity to franklin,c he never would have become an advocate for american independence;d and that, if mirabeau had not suffered in prison,e he never would have written against the lettres / de cachet, or espoused the cause of the people.  all of which assertions i am willing to admit, because they exactly prove what i wish to enforce; namely, that  though bad morals, and worse laws, have helped to deprave the passions of men to such a degree, as to make the benefits which society have derived from the talents or exertions of individuals to arise from selfish considerations, still it has been in a state of gradual improvement, and has arrived at such a pitch of comparative perfection, that the most arbitrary governments in europe, russia excepted, begin to treat their subjects as human beings, feeling like men, and with some powers of thinking.
