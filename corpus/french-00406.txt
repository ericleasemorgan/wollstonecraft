all our entrances are intercepted; our roads, our bridges, and our public walks, are changed into military posts. the notorious events, the secret orders, and precipitate counter-orders  in short, preparations for war, strike every eye, and fill with indignation every heart. gentlemen, if the question were only the insulted dignity of the assembly, it would demand the attention of the king himself; for should he not take care, that we be treated with decency, since we are deputies of the nation from which his glory emanates, which alone constitutes the splendour of the throne?  yes; of that nation, who will render the person of the king honourable in proportion as he respects himself? since his wish is to command free men, it is time to banish the old odious forms, those insulting proceedings, which too easily persuade the courtiers, who surround the prince, that royal majesty consists in the abasing relation of master and slave; that a legitimate and / beloved king ought on all occasions to show himself with the aspect of an irritated tyrant; or, of those usurpers condemned by their melancholy fate, to mistake the tender and flattering sentiments of confidence.  and who will dare to say, that circumstances have rendered necessary these menacing measures? on the contrary, i am going to demonstrate, that they are equally useless and dangerous, considered either with respect to good order, the quieting of the public, or the safety of the throne: and, far from appearing the fruit of a sincere attachment to the person of the monarch, they can only gratify private passions, and cover perfidious designs. undoubtedly i do not know every pretext, every artifice of the enemies of reformation, since i cannot divine with what plausible reason they have coloured the pretended want of troops, at a moment when not only their inutility, but their danger strikes every mind.
