when that wise being who created us and placed us here, saw the fair idea, he willed, by allowing it to be so, that the passions should unfold our reason, because he could see that present evil would produce future good. could the helpless creature whom he called from nothing break loose from his providence, and boldly learn to know good by practising evil, without his permission? no.  how could that energetic advocate for immortality argue so inconsistently? had mankind remained for ever in the brutal state of nature, which even his magic pen cannot paint as a state in which a single virtue took root, / it would have been clear, though not to the sensitive unreflecting wanderer, that man was born to run the circle of life and death, and adorn god's garden for some purpose which could not easily be reconciled with his attributes.
