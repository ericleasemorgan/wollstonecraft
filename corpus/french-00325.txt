many of the officers, who had served in america during the late war,a had beheld the inhabitants of a whole empire living in a state of perfect equality; and returned, charmed with their simplicity and integrity, the concomitants of a just government, erected on the solid foundation of equal liberty, to scan the rectitude, or policy of a different system. convinced of their inutility as nobles, these, when fired with the love of freedom, seconded the views of the commons with heart and / voice. but the sycophants of the court, and the greater part of the nobility, who were grossly ignorant of every thing that was not comprised in the art of living in a continual round of pleasure, insensible of the precipice on which they were standing, would not, at first, recede a single step to save themselves; and this obstinacy was the chief cause that led to the entire new organization of the constitution, framed by the national assembly. the french in reality were arrived, through the vices of their government, at that degree of false refinement, which makes every man, in his own eyes, the centre of the world; and when this gross selfishness, this complete depravity, prevails in a nation, an absolute change must take place; because the members of it have lost the cement of humanity, which kept them together. all other vices are, properly speaking, superfluous strength, powers running to waste; but this morbid spot shows, that there is death in the heart. whatever, indeed, may be the wisdom or folly of a mixed government of king, lords, and commons, is of no consequence in the present history; because it appears sufficiently obvious, that the aristocracy of france destroyed / itself, through the ignorant arrogance of it's members; who, bewildered in a thick fog of prejudices, could discern neither the true dignity of man, nor the spirit of the times.
