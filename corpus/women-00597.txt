the heart of man, though disease and even death lurk in the cup or dainty that elevates the spirits or tickles the palate. the lively heated imagination [likewise, to apply the comparison], draws the picture of love, as it draws every other picture, with those glowing / colours, which the daring hand will steal from the rainbow that is directed by a mind, condemned in a world like this, to prove its noble origin by panting after unattainable perfection; ever pursuing what it acknowledges to be a fleeting dream. an imagination of this vigorous cast can give existence to insubstantial forms, and stability to the shadowy reveries which the mind naturally falls into when realities are found vapid. it can then depict love with celestial charms, and dote on the grand ideal object  it can imagine a degree of mutual affection that shall refine the soul, and not expire when it has served as a 'scale to heavenly;'a and, like devotion, make it absorb every meaner affection and desire. in each others arms, as in a temple, with its summit lost in the clouds, the world is to be shut out, and every thought and wish, that do not nurture pure affection and permanent virtue.  permanent virtue! alas! rousseau, respectable visionary! thy paradise would soon be violated by the entrance of some unexpected guest.b like milton's it would only contain angels, or men sunk below the dignity of rational creatures. happiness is not material, it cannot be seen or / felt! yet the eager pursuit of the good which every one shapes to his own fancy, proclaims man the lord of this lower world, and to be an intelligential creature, who is not to receive, but acquire happiness. they, therefore, who complain of the delusions of passion, do not recollect that they are exclaiming against a strong proof of the immortality of the soul.
