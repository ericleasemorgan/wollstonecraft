let it not be concluded that i wish to invert the order of things; i have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. i speak collectively of the whole sex; but i see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. in fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? i must therefore, if i reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a god./
