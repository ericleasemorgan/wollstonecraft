a christian has still nobler motives to incite her to preserve her chastity and acquire modesty, for her body has been called the temple of the living god;a of that god who requires more than modesty of mien. his eye searcheth the heart; and let her remember, that if she hope to find favour in the sight of purity itself, her chastity must be founded on modesty, and not on worldly prudence; or verily a good reputation will be her only reward; for that awful intercourse, that sacred communication, which virtue establishes between man and his maker, must give rise to the wish of being pure as he is pure!
