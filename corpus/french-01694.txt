shortly after, the king appeared in the assembly, standing uncovered; and without any attention to ceremony. he addressed the representatives of the people with artful affection: for as it is impossible to avoid comparing his present affectionate style, with the cold contempt with which he answered their repeated remonstrances the preceding evening, it is not judging harshly to despise the affectation, and to suggest, that it was dictated rather by selfish prudence than by a sense of justice, or a feeling of humanity. he lamented the disorder that reigned in the capital, and requested them to think of some / method to bring back order and tranquillity. he alluded to the report, that the personal safety of the deputies had been menaced; and, with contemptible duplicity asked, if his well-known character did not give the lie to such a rumour.  reckoning then, he concluded, on the love and fidelity of his subjects, he had given orders to the troops to repair to more distant quarters  and he authorized, nay, invited them, to make known his intentions to the metropolis.
