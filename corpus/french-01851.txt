it too frequently happens, that men run from one extreme to another, and that despair adopts the most violent measures. the french people had long been groaning under the lash / of a thousand oppressions; they were the hewers of wood, and drawers of water, for the chosen few. it was, therefore, to be apprehended, after they had once thrown off the yoke, which had imprinted on their character the hateful scars of servitude, that they would expect the most unbridled freedom, detesting all wholesome restraints, as reins they were not now bound to obey. from observing, perhaps, that this was the disposition of the times, the political empirics have continually inflamed the foibles of the multitude, by flattering them. thus the nobility, whose order would probably lose most by the revolution, made the most popular motions, to gain favour with the people; tickling the spirit they could not tame. thus also we have seen the desperate leaders of factions selecting ingeniously the terms sans-culottes, citoyen, and egalit, in order to cajole the minds of the vulgar;b and hence it has happened, that, in proportion as this cajolery was more highly seasoned, the power of ruling has descended to the most desperate and impudent of the smatterers in politics; whilst public anarchy, and private discord, have been productive of the dreadful catastrophes, and wanton outrages, / which have given such home thrusts to the dignity of freedom.
