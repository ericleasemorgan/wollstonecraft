this is not a discouraging consideration. our ancestors have laboured for us; and we, in our turn, must labour for posterity. it is by tracing the mistakes, and profiting from the discoveries of one generation, that the next is able to take a more elevated stand. the first inventor of any instrument has scarcely ever been able to bring it to a tolerable degree of perfection; and the discoveries of every man of genius, the optics of newton excepted, have been improved, if not extended, by their followers.  can it then be expected, that the science of politics and finance, the most important, and most difficult of all human improvements; a science which involves the passions, tempers, and manners of men and nations, estimates their wants, maladies, comforts, happiness, and misery, and computes the sum of good or evil flowing from social institutions; will not require the same gradations, and advance by steps equally slow / to that state of perfection necessary to secure the sacred rights of every human creature?
