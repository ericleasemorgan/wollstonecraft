whilst the multitude were advancing, the assembly were considering the king's reply to their request to sanction the declaration of rights, and the first articles of the constitution, before the supplies were granted. the reply was couched in terms somewhat vague, yet it's meaning could not be misunderstood.  he observed, that the articles of the constitution could be judged of only in their connection with the whole; nevertheless he thought it natural, that at the moment the nation was called upon to assist the government by a signal act of confidence and patriotism, they should expect to be re-assured respecting their principal interest.  'accordingly,' he continues, 'taking it for granted, that the first articles of the constitution, which you have presented to me, united to the completion of your labours, will satisfy the wishes of my people, and secure the happiness and prosperity of the kingdom, conformably to your desire i accept them; but with one positive condition, from which i will never depart; namely, that from the general result of your deliberations the executive power / shall have it's entire effect in the hands of the monarch. still it remains for me to assure you with frankness, that, if i give my sanction of acceptance to the several articles, which you have laid before me, it is not because they indiscriminately give me an idea of perfection; but i believe it laudable in me to pay this respect to the wishes of the deputies of the nation, and to the alarming circumstances, which so earnestly press us to desire above all things the prompt reestablishment of peace, order, and confidence.
