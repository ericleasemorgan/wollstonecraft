this regard for reputation, independent of its being one of the natural rewards of virtue, however, took its rise from a cause that i have already deplored as the grand source of female depravity, the impossibility of regaining respectability by a return to virtue, though men preserve theirs during the indulgence of vice. it was natural for women then to endeavour to preserve what once lost  was lost for ever, till this care swallowing up every other care, reputation for chastity, became the one thing needful to the sex. but vain is the scrupulosity of ignorance, for neither religion nor virtue, when they reside in the heart, require such a puerile attention to mere ceremonies, because the behaviour must, upon / the whole, be proper, when the motive is pure.
