to give a striking instance, it is only necessary to turn our attention to the fatal effects / that flowed from his consenting to assemble an army of foreigners, to intimidate the states-general. he could not resist the court, who counselled this measure; or silence the misgivings of his heart, which made him averse to the troops taking any decisive step, that might lead to slaughter. and still governed by these undisciplined feelings, when he dismissed the army, he pursued the advice of the very cabal, that had led him into this errour; giving way to the wishes of the people, yet dissembling with them even in the act of reconciliation. thus, for ever wavering, it is difficult to mark any fixt purpose in his actions; excepting that which does him honour  the desire to prevent the shedding of blood. this principle has, in general, directed his conduct; though the short-sighted measures of timid humanity, devoid of strength of mind, turned all his efforts to a very contrary effect.
