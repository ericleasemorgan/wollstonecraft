you must have known that a man of merit cannot rise in the church, the army, or navy, unless he has some interest in a borough; and that even a paltry exciseman's place can only be secured by electioneering interest.b i will go further, and assert that few bishops, though there have been learned and good bishops, have gained the mitre without submitting to a servility of dependence that degrades the man.  all these circumstances you must have known, yet you talk of virtue and liberty, / as the vulgar talk of the letter of the law; and the polite of propriety. it is true that these ceremonial observances produce decorum; the sepulchres are white-washed, and do not offend the squeamish eyes of high rank; but virtue is out of the question when you only worship a shadow, and worship it to secure your property.
