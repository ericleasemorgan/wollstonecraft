'how much wealth, congealed by ostentation into useless heaps, shall melt into flowing streams of prosperity! how much the prudent economy of individuals might / contribute to the restoration of the kingdom! how many treasures, which the piety of our forefathers accumulated on the altars of our temples, will forsake their obscure cells without changing their sacred destination! "this i set apart, in times of prosperity;" says religion; "it is fitting that i dispense it in the day of adversity. it was not for myself  a borrowed lustre adds nothing to my greatness  it was for you, and the state, that i levied this honourable tribute on the virtues of your forefathers."
