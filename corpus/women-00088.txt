 a person is not to act in this or that way, though convinced they are right in so doing, because some equivocal circumstances may lead the world to suspect that they acted from different motives.  this is sacrificing the substance for a shadow. let people but watch their own hearts, and act rightly, as far as they can judge, and they may patiently wait till the opinion of the world comes round. it is best to be directed by a simple motive  for justice has too often been sacrificed to propriety;  another word for convenience.
