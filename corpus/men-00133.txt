it is to this instinct, without doubt, that you allude, when you talk of the 'moral constitution of the heart.' to it, i allow, for i consider it as a congregate of sensations / and passions, poets must apply, 'who have to deal with an audience not yet graduated in the school of the rights of men.'a they must, it is clear, often cloud the understanding, whilst they move the heart by a kind of mechanical spring; but that 'in the theatre the first intuitive glance'b of feeling should discriminate the form of truth, and see her fair proportion, i must beg leave to doubt. sacred be the feelings of the heart! concentred in a glowing flame, they become the sun of life; and, without his invigorating impregnation, reason would probably lie in helpless inactivity, and never bring forth her only legitimate offspring  virtue. but to prove that virtue is really an acquisition of the individual, and not the blind impulse of unerring instinct, the bastard vice has often been begotten by the same father.
