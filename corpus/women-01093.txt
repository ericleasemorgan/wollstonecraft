it is the irregular exercise of parental authority that first injures the mind, and to these irregularities girls are more subject than boys. the will of those who never allow their will to be disputed, unless they happen to be in a good humour, when they relax proportionally, is almost always unreasonable. to elude this arbitrary authority girls very early learn the lessons which they afterwards practice on their husbands; for i have frequently seen a little sharp-faced miss rule a whole family, excepting that now and then mamma's angry will burst out of some accidental cloud;  either her hair was ill dressed, or she had lost more money at cards, the night before, than she was willing to own to her husband; or some such moral cause of anger.
