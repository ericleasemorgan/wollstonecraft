grand machine, so necessary to promote expedition and success, could not subsist without a commander, known and acknowledged by the public: for all the citizens, become soldiers, are perpetually,' he adds, 'exposed to spend their zeal and intrepidity in superfluous efforts; sometimes even counteracting their own designs. it is necessary then to name a general of the first abilities and experience; i am far from thinking myself worthy of your / choice, though i offer all that i can offer, my fortune and my life; and shall willingly serve in any post.'a this motion produced a new discussion; and the duke d'aumontb was appointed commander in chief. but, he half declining it, though he tried to procrastinate his refusal, the post devolved to the marquis de la salle, who had been unanimously named second; and he entered immediately on the discharge of this important trust. and this nomination contributed to support the exertions of the committee; for in spite of the chaotic shock, which seemed to have thrown into confusion all the parts of this great city, the centre of union formed at the htel-de-ville, by the assembling of the electors, was in a great measure the salvation of the public. this muncipal power, created by circumstances, and tacitly consented to by the citizens, established a great degree of order and obedience, even in the midst of terrour and anarchy. the garde-bourgeoise had been assembled in all the districts; and the patrols relieved with the greatest exactness. the streets were illuminated, to prevent confusion or dismay during the night; private property was respected, and all the posts carefully superintended; / but, at the barriers, every carriage and every person was stopped, and obliged to go to the htel-de-ville to give an account of themselves. the public particularly mistrusted the design of those who were going to versailles, or coming from it. deputations had been regularly sent, to inform the national assembly of the disturbances, which their danger and the dread of a siege had occasioned in paris, and of the measures pursued to restrain the headlong fury of the people.
