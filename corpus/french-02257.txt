unanimously agreed to the motion of mirabeau, seconded by barnave, 'that the king and assembly should not be separated during the present sessions.'a mirabeau, and other popular members, were probably glad to have the person of the king secured, without being obliged to appear, in an ostensible manner, in the affair; because they always endeavoured to keep a little hold on the court, whilst they led the people. such are the pitiful shifts of men, who are not guided by the compass of moral principles, which alone render the character dignified or consistent. readily then acquiescing in a measure the most fatal and contemptible, they decreed, that the assembly was inseparable from the person of the king, and sent a deputation to inform him of this resolve, previous to his departure.
