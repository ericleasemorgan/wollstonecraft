mankind, including every description, wish to be loved and respected by something; and the common herd will always take the nearest road to the completion of their wishes. the respect paid to wealth and beauty is the most certain, and unequivocal; and, of course, will always attract the vulgar eye of common minds. abilities and virtues are absolutely necessary to raise men from the middle / rank of life into notice; and the natural consequence is notorious, the middle rank contains most virtue and abilities. men have thus, in one station, at least an opportunity of exerting themselves with dignity, and of rising by the exertions which really improve a rational creature; but the whole female sex are, till their character is formed, in the same condition as the rich: for they are born, i now speak of a state of civilization, with certain sexual privileges, and whilst they are gratuitously granted them, few will ever think of works of supererogation, to obtain the esteem of a small number of superiour people.
