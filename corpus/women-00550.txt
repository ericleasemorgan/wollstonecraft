another argument that has had great weight with me, must, i think, have some force with every considerate benevolent heart. girls who have been thus weakly educated, are often cruelly left by their parents without any provision; and, of course, are dependent on, not only the reason, but the bounty of their brothers. these brothers are, to view the fairest side of the question, good sort of men, and give as a favour, what children of the same parents had an equal right to. in this equivocal humiliating situation, a docile female may remain some time, with a tolerable degree of comfort. but, when the brother marries, a probable circumstance, from being considered as the mistress of the family, she is viewed with averted looks as an intruder, an unnecessary burden on the benevolence of the master of the house, and his new partner.
