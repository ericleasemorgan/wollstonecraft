beneficent prince exalts by his virtues, has emanated the most striking example.  o thou, so justly the dearly beloved of thy people  king  citizen  man of worth! it was thine to cast a glance over the magnificence that surrounded thee, and to convert it into national resources. the objects of luxury which thou hast sacrificed, have added new lustre to thy dignity; and whilst the love of the french for thy sacred person makes them murmur at the privation, their sensibility applauds thy magnanimity; and their generosity will repay thy beneficence by the return it covets, by an imitation of thy virtues, by pursuing thy course in the career of public utility.
