i shall close my extracts with a just description of a comfortable couple. 'and yet you must not imagine, that even such management will always suffice. whatever precaution be taken, enjoyment will, by degrees, take off the edge of passion. but / when love hath lasted as long as possible, a pleasing habitude supplies its place, and the attachment of a mutual confidence succeeds to the transports of passion. children often form a more agreeable and permanent connection between married people than even love itself. when you cease to be the mistress of emilius, you will continue to be his wife and friend, you will be the mother of his children.'c
