the comparison with the rich still occurs to me; for, when men neglect the duties of humanity, women will [follow their example]; a common stream hurries them both along with thoughtless celerity. riches and honours prevent a man from enlarging his understanding, and enervate all his powers by reversing the order of nature, which has ever made true pleasure the reward of labour. pleasure  enervating pleasure is, likewise, within women's reach without earning it. but, till hereditary possessions are spread abroad, how can we expect men to be proud of virtue? and, till they are, women will govern them by the most direct means, neglecting their dull domestic duties to catch the pleasure that [sits lightly] on the wing of time.
