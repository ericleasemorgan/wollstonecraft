i have always found horses, animals i am attached to, very tractable when treated with humanity and steadiness, so that i doubt whether the violent methods taken to break them, do not essentially injure them; i am, however, certain that a child should never be / thus forcibly tamed after it had injudiciously been allowed to run wild; for every violation of justice and reason, in the treatment of children, weakens their reason. and, so early do they catch a character, that the base of the moral character, experience leads me to infer, is fixed before their seventh year, the period during which women are allowed the sole management of children. afterwards it too often happens that half the business of education is to correct, and very imperfectly is it done, if done hastily, the faults, which they would never have acquired if their mothers had had more understanding.
