as necker had not attended in his place, at the sance royale, it gave colour to the rumour, which had for some time prevailed, that he purposed to retire from the ministry: so that, when the king returned, he was followed by an immense crowd, who could not conceal their discontent. under the influence also of the same fear, a number of the deputies hastened to necker, to entreat him not to resign. and the consternation increasing, the queen, who has ever been the first to desert her own plans, when there appeared a shadow of personal danger, sent for him; and, the better to cover the project of the cabinet, prevailed on him not to quit his post. the object of the cabinet he either had not the penetration to discover; or he had not sufficient magnanimity to resign a place, that gratified equally his pride and his avarice. this measure tended to tranquillize the minds of the people, though it was undermining their cause; for trusting to the integrity of this minister, / who promised, 'to live or die with them,'a they did not perceive, that he wanted the energy of soul necessary to enable him to act up to the principles he professed. however, the cause of liberty, as circumstances have proved, did not depend on the talents of one or two men.  it was the fiat of the nation; and the machinations of the tyrants of europe have not yet been able to overturn it; though false patriots have led them, in their ardour for reform, to the commission of actions the most cruel and unjust. every thing was effected by natural causes; and we shall find, if we take a cursory view of the progress of knowledge, that it's advance towards simple principles is invariably in a ratio, which must speedily change the tangled system of european politics.
