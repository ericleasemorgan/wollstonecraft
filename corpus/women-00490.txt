reciprocation of civility / which the dictates of humanity and the politeness of civilization authorise between man and man? and, why do they not discover, when 'in the noon of beauty's power,'a that they are treated like queens only to be deluded by hollow respect, till they are led to resign, or not assume, their natural prerogatives? confined then in cages like the feathered race, they have nothing to do but to plume themselves, and stalk with mock majesty from perch to perch. it is true they are provided with food and raiment, for which they neither toil nor spin;b but health, liberty, and virtue, are given in exchange. but, where, amongst mankind, has been found sufficient strength of mind to enable a being to resign these adventitious prerogatives; one who, rising with the calm dignity of reason above opinion, dared to be proud of the privileges inherent in man? and it is vain to expect it whilst hereditary power chokes the affections and nips reason in the bud.
