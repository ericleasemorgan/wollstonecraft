the stamen of immortality, if i may be allowed the phrase, is the perfectibility of human reason; for, were men created perfect, or did a flood of knowledge break in upon / him, when he arrived at maturity, that precluded error, i should doubt whether his existence would be continued after the dissolution of the body. but, in the present state of things, every difficulty in morals that escapes from human discussion, and equally baffles the investigation of profound thinking, and the lightning glance of genius, is an argument on which i build my belief of the immortality of the soul. reason is, consequentially, the simple power of improvement; or, more properly speaking, of discerning truth. every individual is in this respect a world in itself. more or less may be conspicuous in one being than another; but the nature of reason must be the same in all, if it be an emanation of divinity, the tie that connects the creature with the creator; for, can that soul be stamped with the heavenly image, that is not perfected by the exercise of its own reason? yet outwardly ornamented with elaborate care, and so adorned to delight man, 'that with honour he may love,' the / soul of woman is not allowed to have this distinction, and man, ever placed between her and reason, she is always represented as only created to see through a gross medium, and to take things on trust. but dismissing these fanciful theories, and considering woman as a whole, let it be what it will, instead of a part of man, the inquiry is whether she have reason or not. if she have, which, for a moment, i will take for granted, she was not created merely to be the solace of man, and the sexual should not destroy the human character.
