the simple definition of the reciprocal duty, which naturally subsists between parent and child, may be given in a few words: the parent who pays proper attention to helpless infancy has a right to require the same attention when the feebleness of age comes upon him. but to subjugate a rational being to the mere will of another, after he is of age to answer to society for his own conduct, is a most cruel and undue stretch of power; and, perhaps, as injurious to morality as those religious systems which do not allow right and wrong to have any existence, but in the divine will.
