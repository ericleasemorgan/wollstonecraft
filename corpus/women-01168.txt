girls and boys still together? i hear some readers ask: yes. and i should not fear any other consequence than that some early attachment might take place; which, whilst it had the best effect on the moral character of the young people, might not perfectly agree with the views of the parents, for it will be a long time, i fear, before the world [will be] so far enlightened that parents, only anxious to render their children virtuous, [shall allow] them to choose companions for life themselves.
