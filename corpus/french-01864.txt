the parish priest of soupes,d in the name of his brethren, joined the oblations of the poor to the hecatombs, of which the most part cost nothing to those who proposed them; 'he declared, that, animated by a desire to contribute to the relief of the people, they would relinquish, from the present time, all their casual (or surplice) fees.'e this offer, made with great simplicity of heart, affected the assembly; nor could a very different proposal, made by the duke du chtelet,f respecting the buying up of the tithes, efface it entirely.
