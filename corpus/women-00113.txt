 i have conversed, as man with man, with medical men, on anatomical subjects; and compared the proportions of the human body with artists  yet such modesty did i meet with, that i was never reminded by word or look of my sex, of the absurd rules which make modesty a pharisaical cloak of weakness. and i am persuaded that in the pursuit of knowledge women would never be insulted by sensible men, and rarely by men of any description, if they did not by mock modesty remind them that they were women: actuated by the same spirit as the portugueze ladies, who would think their charms insulted, if, when left alone with a man, he did not, at least, attempt to be grossly familiar with their persons. men are not always men in the company of women, nor would women always remember that they are women, if they were allowed to acquire more understanding.
