some time after, the third deputation also came back, and recounted, that, at the sight of their white flag, one had been hoisted on the top of the bastille, and the soldiers had grounded their arms;  that, under the auspices of these ensigns of peace, the deputies had engaged the people, in the name of the permanent committee, to retire to their districts, and take the measures the most proper to re-establish tranquillity  and, that this retreat was actually taking place; the people all naturally passing through the court where the deputation remained.  when, notwithstanding the white emblem of a pacific disposition, displayed on the tower, the deputies saw a piece of cannon planted directly at the court, and they received a sudden discharge of musketry, which killed three persons at their feet  that this atrocity, at the moment they were calming the people, had thrown them into a transport of rage; and many of them had even held their bayonets at the breasts of the deputies; / saying, 'you are also traitors, and have brought us here that we might be more easily killed'  and it would have been difficult to calm them, if one of the deputies had not bid them observe, that they shared the same danger. the effervescence then abating, they hastened back and met  of the french guards, followed by the cannons taken at the invalids, all marching with a quick step, crying that they were going to take the bastille. one of the deputies, who had been separated from the rest, further recited;  that having been obliged to scramble over the dead and dying to escape, the people, who recognized him as an elector, desired him to save himself  for that the treason was manifest. 'it is rather you, my friends, he replied, who ought to retire; you who hinder our soldiers and cannons from entering this encumbered court, where you are all going to perish, for no purpose.'b but, that they interrupted him in a transport, exclaiming  'no!  no! our dead bodies will serve to fill up the trench.'c he therefore retired with the balls hissing about his ears. these recitals, and the rumour of the second act of treachery, spreading / through the city, violently agitated minds already alive to suspicion.
