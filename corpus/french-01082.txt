why starts the tear of anguish to mingle with recollections that sentiment fosters  even in obedience to reason?  for it is wise to be happy!  and nature and virtue will always open inlets of joy to the heart. but how quickly vanishes this prospect of delights! of delights such as man ought to taste!  the cavalcade of death moves along, shedding mildew over all the beauties of the scene, and blasting every joy! the elegance of the palaces and buildings is revolting, when they are viewed as prisons, and the sprightliness of the people disgusting, when they are hastening to view the operations of the guillotine, or carelessly passing over the earth stained with blood. exasperated humanity then, with bitterness of soul, devotes the city to destruction; whilst turning from such a nest of crimes, it seeks for consolation only in the conviction, that, as the world is growing wiser, it must become happier; and that, as the cultivation of the soil meliorates a climate, the improvement of / the understanding will prevent those baneful excesses of passion which poison the heart.
