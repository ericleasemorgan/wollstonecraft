'the reply of the king is a pointed refusal. the ministry would have it regarded only as a simple form of assurance and goodness; and they have affected to think, that we have made our demand, without attaching much interest to it's success, and only to appear to have made it. it is necessary to undeceive the ministry  certainly, my opinion is, not to fail in the confidence and respect which we owe to the virtues of the king; but i likewise advise, that we be no more inconsistent, timid, and wavering in our measures.  certainly, there is no need to deliberate on the removal proposed; for, in short, notwithstanding the king's answer, we will not go to noyon, nor to soissons  we have not demanded this permission; nor will we, because it is scarcely probable, that we should ever desire to place ourselves between / two or three bodies of troops; those which invest paris, and those which might fall upon us from flanders and alsace. we have demanded the removal of the troops  that was the object of our address!  we have not asked permission to flee before them; but only that they should be sent from the capital. and it is not for ourselves, that we have made this demand; for they know very well, that it was suggested by a concern for the general interest, not by any sentiment of fear. at this moment, the presence of the troops disturbs the public order, and may produce the most melancholy events.  our removal, far from preventing, would, on the contrary, only aggravate the evil. it is necessary, then, to restore peace, in spite of the friends of disorder; it is necessary, to be consistent with ourselves; and to be so, we have only to adhere to one line of conduct, which is to insist, without relaxing, that the troops be sent away, as the only sure way to obtain it.'a
