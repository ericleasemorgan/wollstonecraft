an officer of the queen's regiment of guards (m. elie)a was brought in on the shoulders of / the conquerors of the bastille, and proclaimed by them, as the first of the citizens, who had just made themselves masters of it. the efforts he used to repress the testimonies of honour, which were lavished on him, were of no avail; and he was placed, in spite of his modesty, on a table opposite the committee, and surrounded by the prisoners, who seemed to be standing in fearful expectation of their doom. in this situation he was crowned, and trophies of arms awkwardly placed around, to which sentiment and circumstances gave dignity. all the plate taken at the bastille was brought to him, and his comrades pressed him, in the most earnest manner, to accept it, as the richest spoil of the vanquished enemy. but he refused with firmness, explaining the motives of his refusal so eloquently, he persuaded all who heard him, that the spoil did not belong to them; and that patriotism, jealous only of glory and honour, would blush at receiving a pecuniary recompense.  and, making a noble use of the ascendency which he had over the people, he began to recommend moderation and clemency.  but he was soon interrupted by the account of the death of delaunay; seized in the court of the bastille, / and dragged by the furious populace almost to the htel-de-ville, before he was massacred.  and soon after the death of three other officers was reported.
