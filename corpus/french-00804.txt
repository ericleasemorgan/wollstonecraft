have fixed on a system proper only for a people in the highest stage of civilization:  a system of itself calculated to disorganize the government, and throw embarrassments into all it's operations. this was an errour so gross, as to demand the severest animadversions. for this political plan, ever considered as utopian by all men who had not traced the progress of reason, or calculated the degree of perfectibility the human faculties are capable of attaining, was, it might be presumed, the most improper for the degenerate society of france. the exertions of the very admirers of the revolution were, likewise, far from being / permanent; and they could hardly have been expected to possess sufficient virtue to support a government, the duration of which they at least feared would be short. the men termed experienced believed it physically impossible; and no arguments were cogent enough to convince them of the contrary: so that, they leaving the task to mock patriots and enthusiasts, a fresh odium has been thrown on principles, which, notwithstanding are gaining ground. things must be left to their natural course; and the accelerating progress of truth promises to demonstrate, what no arguments have hitherto been able to prove.
