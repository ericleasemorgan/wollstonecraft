with respect to the improvement of society, since the destruction of the roman empire, england seems to have led the way, rendering certain obstinate prejudices almost null, by a gradual change of opinion. this observation, / which facts will support, may be brought forward, to prove, that just sentiments gain footing only in proportion as the understanding is enlarged by cultivation, and freedom of thought, instead of being cramped by the dread of bastilles and inquisitions. in italy and france, for example, where the mind dared to exercise itself only to form the taste, the nobility were, in the strictest sense of the word, a cast, keeping aloof from the people; whilst in england they intermingled with the commercial men, whose equal or superiour fortunes made the nobles overlook their inequality of birth: thus giving the first blow to the ignorant pride that retarded the formation of just opinions respecting true dignity of character. this monied interest, from which political improvement first emanates, was not yet formed in france; and the ridiculous pride of her nobles, which led them to believe, that the purity of their families would be sullied, if they agreed to act in the same sphere with the people, was a prevailing motive, that prevented their junction with the commons. but the more licentious part of the clergy, who followed with a truer scent their own interest, thought it expedient to / espouse, in time, the cause of the power, from whence their influence derived its greatest force; and from which alone they could hope for support. this schism proved, as it promised, dangerous to the views of the court.
