such are the opposite sentiments, or rather conduct of court parasites, and men struggling to be free, that it is sufficient to contrast them. the deputies, whose lives had been threatened, and their persons grossly insulted, not only excused the ill advised monarch for the countenance which he had given to the violation of the most sacred principles; but expressed a conciliatory disposition to all parties. the mob, it is true, in the heat of rage, inhumanly butchered two of the vile instruments of despotism.a but this violence offered to justice ought not to be attributed to the temper of the people, much less to the connivance of the national assembly, who acted with a degree of magnanimity, at this time, of which it can never be enough lamented that they have since lost sight. the behaviour however of the hardened children of oppression in all countries is the same; whether in the amphitheatre at rome, or around the lantern-post in paris.
