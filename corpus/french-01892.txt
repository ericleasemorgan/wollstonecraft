for a vain glorious ambition, mixing with the abortions of giddy patriotism, acts as the most fatal poison to political disquisitions, during seasons of public ferment. the solid views of deep thinkers are adapted to the spirit of the times, and the state of reason of their compeers. and if they find, that the current opinion, in overturning inveterate prejudices, and the decayed walls of laws, that no longer suit the manners, threatens the destruction of principles the most sacred; they ought firmly to wait at their post, until, the fervour abating, they could, by diverting the stream, gradually restrain it within proper bounds.  but such patriotism is of slow growth; requiring both a luxuriant public soil, and to be fostered by virtuous emulation. yet this emulation will never flourish in a country where intriguing finesse, supplying the place of exalted merit, is the surest ladder to / distinction. it was by debasing artifices, under the old government, that men obtained favour and consequence; and whilst such men, men who were educated and ossified by the ancient regimen, act on the political stage of france, mankind will be continually distressed and amused by their tragic and comic exhibitions.
