to render women truly useful members of society, i argue that they should be led, by having their undertakings cultivated on a large scale, to acquire a rational affection for their country, founded on knowledge, because it is obvious that we are little interested about what we do not understand. and to render this general knowledge of due importance, i have endeavoured to shew that private duties are never properly fulfilled unless the understanding enlarges the heart; and that public virtue is only an aggregate of private. but, the distinctions established in / society undermine both, by beating out the solid gold of virtue, till it becomes only the tinsel-covering of vice; for whilst wealth renders a man more respectable than virtue, wealth will be sought before virtue; and, whilst women's persons are caressed, when a childish simper shews an absence of mind  the mind will lie fallow. yet, true voluptuousness must proceed from the mind  for what can equal the sensations produced by mutual affection, supported by mutual respect? what are the cold, or feverish caresses of appetite, but sin embracing death, compared with the modest overflowings of a pure heart and exalted imagination? yes, let me tell the libertine of fancy when he despises understanding in woman  that the mind, which he disregards, gives life to the enthusiastic affection from which rapture, short-lived as it is, alone can flow! and, that, without virtue, a sexual attachment must expire, like a tallow candle in the socket, creating intolerable disgust. to prove this, i need only observe, that men who have wasted great part of their lives with women, and with whom they have sought for pleasure with eager thirst, entertain the meanest opinion of the sex.  virtue, true refiner of joy! /  if foolish men were to fright thee from earth, in order to give loose to all their appetites without a check  some sensual wight of taste would scale the heavens to invite thee back, to give a zest to pleasure!
