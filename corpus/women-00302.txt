i may be accused of arrogance; still i must declare what i firmly believe, that all the writers who have written on the subject of female education and manners from rousseau to dr gregory,a have contributed to render women more artificial, weak characters, than they would otherwise have been; and, consequently, more useless members of society. i might have expressed this conviction in a lower key; but i am afraid it would have / been the whine of affectation, and not the faithful expression of my feelings, of the clear result, which experience and reflection have led me to draw. when i come to that division of the subject, i shall advert to the passages that i more particularly disapprove of, in the works of the authors i have just alluded to; but it is first necessary to observe, that my objection extends to the whole purport of those books, which tend, in my opinion, to degrade one half of the human species, and render women pleasing at the expence of every solid virtue.
