he shall speak for himself, for thus he makes nature address man. 'behold these smiling innocents, whom i have graced with my fairest gifts, and committed to your protection; behold them with love and respect; treat them with tenderness and honour. they are timid and want to be defended. they are frail; o do not take advantage of their weakness! let their fears and blushes endear them. let their confidence in you never be abused.  but is it possible, that any of you can be such barbarians, so supremely wicked, as to abuse it? can you find in your hearts to despoil the gentle, trusting creatures of their treasure, or do any thing to strip them of their native robe of virtue? curst be the impious hand that would dare to violate the unblemished form of chastity! thou / wretch! thou ruffian! forbear; nor venture to provoke heaven's fiercest vengeance.'a i know not any comment that can be made seriously on this curious passage, and i could produce many similar ones; and some, so very sentimental, that i have heard rational men use the word indecent, when they mentioned them with disgust.
