pleasure is the business of woman's life, according to the present modification of society, and while it continues to be so, little can be expected from such weak beings. inheriting, in a lineal descent from the first fair defect in nature, the sovereignty of beauty, they have, to maintain their power, resigned the natural rights, which the exercise of reason might have procured them, and chosen rather to be short-lived queens than labour to obtain the sober pleasures that arise from equality. exalted by their inferiority (this sounds like a contradiction), they constantly demand homage as women, though experience should teach them that the men who pride themselves upon paying this arbitrary insolent respect to the sex, with the most scrupulous / exactness, are most inclined to tyrannize over, and despise, the very weakness they cherish. often do they repeat mr hume's sentiments; when, comparing the french and athenian character, he alludes to women. 'but what is more singular in this whimsical nation, say i to the athenians, is, that a frolick of yours during the saturnalia,a when the slaves are served by their masters, is seriously continued by them through the whole year, and through the whole course of their lives; accompanied too with some circumstances, which still further augment the absurdity and ridicule. you[r] sport only elevates for a few days those whom fortune has thrown down, and whom she too, in sport, may really elevate for ever above you. but this nation gravely exalts those, whom nature has subjected to them, and whose inferiority and infirmities are absolutely incurable. the women, though without virtue, are their masters and sovereigns.'b
