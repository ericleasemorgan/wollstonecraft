why should the minds of children be warped as they just begin to expand, only to favour the indolence of parents, who insist on a privilege without being willing to pay the price fixed by nature? i have before had / occasion to observe, that a right always includes a duty, and i think it may, likewise, fairly be inferred, that they forfeit the right, who do not fulfil the duty.
