i know that a lively imagination renders a man particularly calculated to shine in conversation and in those desultory productions where method is disregarded; and the instantaneous applause which his eloquence extorts is at once a reward and a spur.a once a wit and always a wit, is an aphorism that has received the sanction of experience; yet i am apt to conclude that the man who with scrupulous anxiety endeavours to support that shining / character, can never nourish by reflection any profound, or, if you please, metaphysical passion. ambition becomes only the tool of vanity, and his reason, the weather-cock of unrestrained feelings, is only employed to varnish over the faults which it ought to have corrected.
