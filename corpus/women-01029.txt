i know that, as a proof of the inferiority of the sex, rousseau has exultingly exclaimed, how can they leave the nursery for the camp!a  and the camp has by some moralists been termed the school of the most heroic virtues; though, i think, it would puzzle a keen casuist to prove the reasonableness of the greater number of wars that have dubbed heroes. i do not mean to consider this question critically; because, having frequently viewed these freaks of ambition as the first natural mode of civilization, when the ground must be torn up, and the woods cleared by fire and sword, i do not choose to call them pests; but surely the present system of war has little connection with virtue of any denomination, being rather the school of finesse and effeminacy, than of fortitude.
