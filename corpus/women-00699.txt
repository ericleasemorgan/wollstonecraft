the man who can be contented to live with a pretty, useful companion, without a mind, has lost in voluptuous gratifications a taste for more refined enjoyments; he has never felt the calm satisfaction, that refreshes the parched heart, like the silent dew of heaven,  of being beloved by one who could understand him.  in the society of his wife he is still alone, unless when the man is sunk in the brute. 'the charm of life,' says a grave philosophical reasoner, is 'sympathy'; nothing pleases us more than to observe in other men a fellow-feeling with all the emotions of our own breast.'a
