machiavelian cunning, however, still directed the movements of all the courts of europe; and these political moles, too well perceiving the timidity that was mixed with the blustering courage of the assembly, only waited for a favourable season to overturn the rising edifice. their agents had private instructions to promote the escape of louis, as the surest mode of making a decided schism in the national politics; and they firmly believed, that the affection still subsisting for his christian majesty would facilitate the execution of their plan. the court also presuming on the divisions and lenity of the assembly, took the most indefatigable pains to foster in the mind of the public, nay, in that of all europe, pity for the degraded person of the / king, and detestation of the sacrilege, which had been committed on the dignity of royalty. their continual theme was the ignominious state to which the most mild of the bourbonsa was reduced, by men, who usurped the reins of government, and trampled on the honours of that august and ancient family. restraining the authority of a throne, which supported the most abominable tyranny, they were shaking the despotism, which held in bondage nine-tenths of the inhabitants of the world. these were alarming signals to a certain class of men, to the drones and myrmidons who live on the spoil and blood of industry and innocence. the intrusion of knowledge, which was sure to render them an useless set of beings in society, was to be prevented by ingenious clamours, whilst a great number of weak, well-meaning people, and still more knaves, enlisted under their banner.
