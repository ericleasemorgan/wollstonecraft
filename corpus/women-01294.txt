so far is this first inclination carried, that even the hellish yoke of slavery cannot stifle the savage desire of admiration which the black heroes inherit from both their parents, for all the hardly earned savings of a slave are commonly expended in a little tawdry finery. and i have seldom known a good male or female servant that was not particularly fond of dress. their clothes were their riches; and, i argue from analogy, that the fondness for dress, so extravagant in females, arises from the same cause  want of cultivation of mind. when men meet they converse about business, politics, or literature; but, says swift, 'how naturally do women apply their hands to each others lappets and ruffles.'a and very natural is it  for they have not any business to interest them, have not a taste for literature, and they find politics dry, because they have not acquired a love for mankind by turning their thoughts to the grand pursuits that exalt the human race, and promote general happiness.
