in france there is undoubtedly a more general diffusion of knowledge than in any part of the european world, and i attribute it, in / a great measure, to the social intercourse which has long subsisted between the sexes. it is true, i utter my sentiments with freedom, that in france the very essence of sensuality has been extracted to regale the voluptuary, and a kind of sentimental lust has prevailed, which, together with the system of duplicity that the whole tenour of their political and civil government taught, have given a sinister sort of sagacity to the french character, properly termed finesse; [from which naturally flow] a polish of manners that injures the substance, by hunting sincerity out of society.  and, modesty, the fairest garb of virtue! has been more grossly insulted in france than even in england, till their women have treated as prudish that attention to decency, which brutes instinctively observe.
