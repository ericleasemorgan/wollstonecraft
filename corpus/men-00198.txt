reading your reflections warily over, it has continually and forcibly struck me, that had you been a frenchman, you would have been, in spite of your respect for rank and antiquity, a violent revolutionist; and deceived, as you now probably are, by the passions that cloud your reason, have termed your romantic enthusiasm an enlightened love of your country, a benevolent respect for the rights of men. your imagination would have taken fire, and have found arguments, full as ingenious as those you now offer, to prove that the constitution, of which so few pillars remained, that constitution which time had almost obliterated, was not a model sufficiently noble to deserve close adherence. and, for the english constitution, you might not have had such a profound veneration as you have lately acquired; nay, it / is not impossible that you might have entertained the same opinion of the english parliament, that you professed to have during the american war.
