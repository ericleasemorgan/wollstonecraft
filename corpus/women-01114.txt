but, what boy ever recollected with pleasure the years he spent in close confinement, at an academy near london? unless, indeed, he should, by chance, remember the poor scare-crow of an usher,a whom he tormented; or, the tartman, from whom he caught a cake, to devour it with a cattish appetite of selfishness. at boarding-schools of every description, the relaxation of the junior boys is mischief; and of the senior, vice. besides, in great schools, what can be more prejudicial to the moral character than the system of tyranny and abject slavery which is established amongst the boys, to say nothing of the slavery to forms, which makes religion worse than a farce? for what good can be expected from the youth who receives the sacrament of the lord's supper, to avoid forfeiting half a guinea, which he probably afterwards spends in some sensual manner? half the employment of the youths is to elude the necessity of attending public worship; and well they may, for such a constant repetition of the / same thing must be a very irksome restraint on their natural vivacity. as these ceremonies have the most fatal effect on their morals, and as a ritual performed by the lips, when the heart and mind are far away, is not now stored up by our church as a bank to draw on for the fees of the poor souls in purgatory, why should they not be abolished?
