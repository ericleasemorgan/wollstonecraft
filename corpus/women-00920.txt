but, if the sexes be really to live in a state of warfare, if nature [have] pointed it out, let [them] act nobly, or let pride whisper to them, that the victory is mean when they merely vanquish sensibility. the real conquest is that over affection not taken by surprise  when, like heloisa, a woman gives up all the world, deliberately, for love.a i do not now consider the wisdom or virtue of such a sacrifice, i only contend that it was a sacrifice to affection, and not merely to sensibility, though she had her share.  and i must be allowed to call her a modest woman, before i dismiss this part of the subject, by saying, that till men are more chaste women will be immodest. where, indeed, could modest women find husbands from whom they would / not continually turn with disgust? modesty must be equally cultivated by both sexes, or it will ever remain a sickly hot-house plant, whilst the affectation of it, the fig leaf borrowed by wantonness, may give a zest to voluptuous enjoyments.
