the mentioning of the name of christ, after such vile impostors, may displease some of my readers  i respect their warmth; but let them not forget that the followers of these delusions bear his name, and profess to be the disciples of him, who said, by their works we should know who were the children of god or the servants of sin. i allow that it is easier to touch the body of a saint, or to be magnetised, than to restrain our appetites or govern our passions; but health of body or mind can only be recovered by these means, or we make the supreme judge partial and revengeful.
