'they who pass their whole lives in working for their daily bread, have no ideas beyond their business or their interest, and all their understanding seems to lie in their fingers' ends. this ignorance is neither prejudicial to their integrity nor their morals; it is often of service to them. sometimes, by means of reflection, we are led to compound with our duty, and we conclude by substituting a jargon of words, in the room of things. our own conscience is the most enlightened philosopher. there is no need to be acquainted with tully's offices,a to make a man of probity: and perhaps the most virtuous woman in the / world, is the least acquainted with the definition of virtue. but it is no less true, that an improved understanding [only can] render society agreeable; and it is a melancholy thing for a father of a family, who is fond of home, to be obliged to be always wrapped up in himself, and to have nobody about him to whom he can impart his sentiments.
