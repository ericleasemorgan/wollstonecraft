a sentiment of this kind glanced across my mind when i read the following exclamation. 'whilst the royal captives, who followed in the train, were slowly moved along, amidst the horrid yells, and shrilling screams, and frantic dances, and infamous contumelies, and all the unutterable abominations of the furies of hell, in the abused shape of the vilest of women.' probably you mean women who gained a livelihood by selling vegetables or fish, who never had had any advantages / of education; or their vices might have lost part of their abominable deformity, by losing part of their grossness. the queen of france  the great and small vulgar, claim our pity; they have almost insuperable obstacles to surmount in their progress towards true dignity of character; still i have such a plain downright understanding that i do not like to make a distinction without a difference. but it is not very extraordinary that you should, for throughout your letter you frequently advert to a sentimental jargon, which has long been current in conversation, and even in books of morals, though it never received the regal stamp of reason. a kind of mysterious instinct is supposed to reside in the soul, that instantaneously discerns truth, without the tedious labour of ratiocination. this instinct, for i know not what other name to give it, has been termed common sense, and more frequently sensibility; and, by a kind of indefeasible / right, it has been supposed, for rights of this kind are not easily proved, to reign paramount over the other faculties of the mind, and to be an authority from which there is no appeal.
