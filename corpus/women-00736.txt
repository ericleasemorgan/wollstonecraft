is not the following portrait  the portrait of a house slave? 'i am astonished at the folly of many women, who are still reproaching their husbands for leaving them alone, for preferring this or that company to theirs, for treating them with this and the other mark of disregard or indifference; when, to speak the truth, 'they have themselves in a great measure to blame. not that i would justify the men in any thing wrong on their part. but had you behaved to them with more respectful observance, and a more equal tenderness; studying their humours, overlooking their mistakes, submitting to their opinions in matters indifferent, passing by little instances of unevenness, caprice, or passion, giving soft answers to hasty words, complaining as seldom as possible, and making it your daily care to relieve their anxieties and prevent their wishes, to enliven the hour of dulness, and call up the ideas of felicity: had you pursued this conduct, i doubt not but you would have maintained and even increased their esteem, so far as to have secured every degree of influence that could / conduce to their virtue, or your mutual satisfaction; and your house might at this day have been the abode of domestic bliss.'b such a woman ought to be an angel  or she is an ass  for i discern not a trace of the human character, neither reason nor passion in this domestic drudge, whose being is absorbed in that of a tyrant's.
