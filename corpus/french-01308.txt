us, that we are naturally inclined to evil: we shall then leave room for the expansion of the human heart, and, i trust, find, that men will insensibly render each other happier as they grow wiser. it is indeed the necessity of stifling many of it's most spontaneous desires, to obtain the factitious virtues of society, that makes man vicious, by depriving him of that dignity of character, which rests only on truth. for it is not paradoxical to assert, that the social virtues / are nipt in the bud by the very laws of society. one principal of action is sufficient  respect thyself  whether it be termed fear of god  religion; love of justice  morality; or, self-love  the desire of happiness. yet, how can a man respect himself; and if not, how believe in the existence of virtue; when he is practising the daily shifts, which do not come under the cognisance of the law, in order to obtain a respectable situation in life? it seems, in fact, to be the business of a civilized man, to harden his heart, that on it he may sharpen the wit; which, assuming the appellation of sagacity, or cunning, in different characters, is only a proof, that the head is clear, because the heart is cold.
