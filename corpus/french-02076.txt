'how will our courage in the exercise of the functions, you have confided to us, be renewed! with what vigour shall we labour in forming the constitution, when secured from interruption! we have sworn to save our country  judge of our anguish, whilst it trembles on the verge of destruction. a momentary sacrifice is sufficient; a sacrifice offered to the public good, and not to the encroachments of covetousness. and is this easy expiation of the faults and blunders of a period, stigmatized by political servitude, above our strength? think of the price which has been paid for liberty by other nations, who have shown themselves worthy of it:  for this, rivers of blood have streamed  long years of woe, and horrid civil wars, have every where preceded the glorious birth!  of us nothing is required, but a pecuniary sacrifice  and even this vulgar offering is not an impoverishing gift:  it will return into our bosom, to enrich our cities, our fields; augmenting our national glory and prosperity.'a/
