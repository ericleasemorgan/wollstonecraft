poizing thus the pillars of equal liberty, the discussion was the next dayb interrupted by the report made by the committee appointed for the purpose of digesting the information sent to the assembly, of the melancholy / intelligence which they daily received from the provinces.  'the taxes, the rents were no longer paid, the revenue was exhausted, the laws were without force; and the social ties almost broken.'c to remedy so many evils, the committee proposed to the assembly to publish, as soon as possible, a solemn declaration to testify their deep sense of the misery of the provinces, and their disapprobation of the non-payment of taxes and rents; and to declare, that, till the assembly had time to consider the decrees necessary to be passed to regulate these objects, there did not exist any cause to justify similar refusals. this proposition occasioned a warm debate.
