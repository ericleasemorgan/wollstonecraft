i have, sir, been reading, with a scrutinizing, comparative eye, several of your insensible and profane speeches during the king's illness. i disdain to take advantage of a man's weak side, or draw consequences from an unguarded transport  a lion preys not on carcasses! but on this occasion you acted systematically. it was not the passion of the moment, over which humanity draws a veil: no; what but the odious maxims of machiavelian policy could have led you to have searched in the very dregs of misery for forcible arguments to support your party? had not vanity or interest steeled your heart, you would have been shocked at the cold insensibility which could carry a man to those dreadful mansions, where human weakness appears in its most awful form to calculate the / chances against the king's recovery. impressed as you are with respect for royalty, i am astonished that you did not tremble at every step, lest heaven should avenge on your guilty head the insult offered to its viceregent. but the conscience that is under the direction of transient ebullitions of feeling, is not very tender or consistent, when the current runs another way.
