the air of fashion, which many young people are so eager to attain, always strikes me like the studied attitudes of some modern [pictures], copied with tasteless servility after the antiques;  the soul is left out, and none of the parts are tied together by what may properly be termed character. this varnish of fashion, which seldom sticks very close to sense, may dazzle the weak; but leave nature to itself, and it will seldom disgust the wise. besides, when a woman has sufficient sense not to pretend to any thing which she does not understand in some degree, there is no need of determining to hide her talents under a bushel.b let things take their natural course, and all will be well.
