i do not intend to be sarcastically paradoxical when i say, that women of fashion take husbands that they may have it in their power to coquet, the grand business of genteel life, with a number of admirers, and thus flutter the spring of life away, without laying up any store for the winter of age, or being of any use to society. affection in the marriage state can only be founded on respect  and are these weak beings respectable? children are neglected for lovers, and we express surprise that adulteries are so common! a woman never forgets to adorn herself to make an impression on the senses of the other sex, and to extort / the homage which it is gallant to pay, and yet we wonder that they have such confined understandings.
