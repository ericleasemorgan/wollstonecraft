pretexts demanded such a number of passports, as to make the president express some apprehension lest the assembly should thus indirectly dissolve itself; whilst other deputies uttered a profusion of indecent sarcasms on a conduct, which the behaviour of the populace, and even of these very orators, seemed to justify. mirabeau, who so earnestly desired to be at paris, ridiculed with unbecoming bitterness every opposition made to the removal of the assembly; yet, listening to the representation, that the allowing so many malecontents to retire into the provinces might produce dangerous fermentations, he proposed that no passport should be granted, till the deputy who demanded it had made known his reason for so doing to the assembly. a letter from the king, notifying his intention of residing most part of his time at paris, and expressing his assurance, that they did not mean to separate / themselves from him, now requested them to send commissioners to paris, to search for a proper place, where they might in future hold their sessions. they accordingly determined to go thither, conformably to the decree of the sixth of october, when a convenient situation should be found.
