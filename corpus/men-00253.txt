what salutary dews might not be shed to refresh this thirsty land, if men were more enlightened! smiles and premiums might encourage cleanliness, industry, and emulation.  a garden more inviting than eden would then meet the eye, and springs of joy murmur on every side. the clergyman would superintend his own flock, the shepherd would then love the sheep he daily tended; the school might rear its decent head, and the buzzing tribe, let loose to play, impart a portion of their vivacious spirits to the heart that longed to open their minds, and lead them to taste the pleasures of men. domestic comfort, the civilizing relations of husband, brother, and father, would soften labour, and render life contented.
