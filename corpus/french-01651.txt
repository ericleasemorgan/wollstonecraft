it was a circumstance favourable to the people, and the cause of humanity, that the want of common foresight in the court prevented their guarding against resistance. for so negligent were they, that the citizens, who were early in the morning of the th every where scouring about in search of arms, requested of the committee an order to demand those they heard were stored up at the htel des invalides;a and one of the electors was accordingly sent with them, to desire the governor to give up to the nation all the arms and ammunition committed to his care. he replied, that a body of citizens having already been with him, he had sent to versailles for orders, and entreated them to wait till the return of the courier, whom he expected in the course of an hour or two. this answer at first satisfied the people, who were preparing to wait contentedly, till one of them observing, that this was not a day to lose time, they insisted on entering immediately; and instantly made themselves masters of all the arms they found, to the amount of , muskets, and six pieces of cannon. a considerable quantity of different sorts of arms / were also carried away from the garde meuble,b by a less orderly party; and fell into the hands of vagabonds, who always mix in a tumult, merely because it is a tumult. a hundred and fifty persons of this description had been disarmed the preceding night at the htel-de-ville, where they had dropped asleep on the stairs and benches, stupified by the brandy they had stolen: but, when they awoke, and requested work, not having any money or bread, they were sent to assist in the making of pikes, and the fabricating of other weapons, which required little skill. none of the citizens appeared, in fact, without some weapon, however uncouth, to brandish defiance, whilst sixty thousand men, enrolled and distributed in different companies, were armed in a more orderly, though not in a more warlike manner. the army of liberty now, indeed, assumed a very formidable appearance; yet the cabinet, never doubting of success, neglected in the thoughtlessness of security, the only way left to oblige the roused people to accept of any terms.
