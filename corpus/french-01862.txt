the president de saint-fargeaua now rose, to demand an explanation relative to the taxes / of which the clergy and nobility offered to divide the weight. 'we have given,' said he, 'hopes to the people; but we ought to give them something more substantial; we have decreed, that, provisionally, the taxes should continue to be paid as they have been hitherto; that is to say, we have reserved to the clergy and the nobility the benefit of their exemptions, till they are expressly revoked.  why do we delay to pronounce this revocation, so strictly imposed in almost all our instructions?  i propose, therefore, that not only for the last six months, but from the very commencement of the year, all privileged persons, without exception, support their proportional part of the public impost.'b
