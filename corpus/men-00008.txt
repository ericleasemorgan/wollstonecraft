it is not necessary, with courtly insincerity, to apologise to you for thus intruding on your precious time, not to profess that i think it an honour to discuss an important subject with a man whose literary abilities have raised him to notice in the state.a i have not yet learned to twist my periods, nor, in the equivocal idiom of politeness, to disguise my sentiments, and imply what i should be afraid to utter: / if, therefore, in the course of this epistle, i chance to express contempt, and even indignation, with some emphasis, i beseech you to believe that it is not a flight of fancy; for truth, in morals, has ever appeared to me the essence of the sublime; and, in taste, simplicity the only criterion of the beautiful. but i war not with an individual when i contend for the rights of menb and the liberty of reason. you see i do not condescend to cull my words to avoid the invidious phrase, nor shall i be prevented from giving a manly definition of it, by the flimsy ridicule which a lively fancy has interwoven with the present acceptation of the term. reverencing the rights of humanity, i shall dare to assert them; not intimidated by the horse laugh that you have raised, or waiting till time has wiped away the compassionate tears which you have elaborately laboured to excite./
