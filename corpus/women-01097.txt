the affections of children, and weak people, are always selfish; they love [their relatives, because they are beloved by] them, and not on account of their virtues. yet, till esteem / and love are blended together in the first affection, and reason made the foundation of the first duty, morality will stumble at the threshold. but, till society is very differently constituted, parents, i fear, will still insist on being obeyed, because they will be obeyed, and constantly endeavour to settle that power on a divine right which will not bear the investigation of reason. /
