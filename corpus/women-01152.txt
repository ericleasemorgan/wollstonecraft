with what a languid yawn have i seen an admirable poem thrown down, that a man of true taste returns to, again and again with rapture; and, whilst melody has almost suspended respiration, a lady has asked me where i bought my gown. i have seen also an eye glanced coldly over a most exquisite picture, rest, sparkling with pleasure, on a caricature rudely sketched; and whilst some terrific feature in nature has spread a sublime stillness through my soul, i have been desired to observe the pretty tricks of a lap-dog, that my perverse fate forced me to travel with. is it surprising that such a tasteless being / should rather caress this dog than her children? or, that she should prefer the rant of flattery to the simple accents of sincerity?
