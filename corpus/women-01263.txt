i know that many devout people boast of submitting to the will of god blindly, as to an arbitrary sceptre or rod, on the same principle as the indians worship the devil. in other words, like people in the common concerns of life, they do homage to power, and cringe under the foot that can crush them. rational religion, on the contrary, is a submission to the will of a being so perfectly wise, that all he wills must be directed by the proper motive  must be reasonable.
