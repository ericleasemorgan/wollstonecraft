whilst, therefore, the sumptuous galas of the court of france were the grand source of the refinement of the arts, taste became the antidote of ennui; and when sentiments had taken place of chivalrous and gothic tournaments, / the reign of philosophy succeeded that of the imagination. and though the government, enveloped in precedents, adjusted still the idle ceremonials, which were no longer imposing, blind to the imperceptible change of things and opinions, as if their faculties were bound by an eternal frost, the progress was invariable; till, reaching a certain point, paris, which from the particular formation of the empire had been such an useful head to it, began to be the cause of dreadful calamities, extending from individuals to the nation, and from the nation to europe. thus it is, that we are led to blame those, who insist, that, because a state of things has been productive of good, it is always respectable; when, on the contrary, the endeavouring to keep alive any hoary establishment, beyond it's natural date, is often pernicious and always useless.
