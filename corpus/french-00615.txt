servility, destroying the natural energy of man, stifles the noblest sentiments of the soul.  thus debased, heroic actions are merely directed by the head, and the heart drops not into them it's balm, more precious than the trees of arabia ever distilled! ought we then to wonder, that this dry substitute for humanity is often burnt up by the scorching flame of revenge? this has now actually been the case; for there has been seen amongst the french a spurious race of men, a set of cannibals, who have gloried in their crimes; and tearing out the hearts that did not feel for them, have proved, that they themselves had iron bowels. 'but, if the anger of the people be terrible,' exclaims mirabeau, 'it is / the sang froid of despotism, that is atrocious; those systematic cruelties, which have made more wretches in a day than the popular insurrections have immolated in a course of years! we often fear,' adds he, 'the people, because we have injured them; and thus are forced to fetter those we oppress.'b
