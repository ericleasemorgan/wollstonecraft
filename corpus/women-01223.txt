discussing the advantages which a public and private education combined, as i have sketched, might rationally be expected to produce, i have dwelt most on such as are particularly relative to the female world, because i think the female world oppressed; yet the gangrene, which the vices engendered by oppression have produced, is not confined to the morbid part, but pervades society at large: so that when i wish to see my sex become more like moral agents, my heart bounds with the anticipation of the general diffusion of that sublime contentment which only morality can diffuse. /
