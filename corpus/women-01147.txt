i have already animadverted on the bad habits which females acquire when they are shut up together; and, i think, that the observation may fairly be extended to the other sex, till the natural inference is drawn which i have had in view throughout  that to improve both sexes they ought, not only in private families, but in public schools, to be educated together. if marriage be the cement of society, mankind should all be educated after the same model, or the intercourse of the sexes will never deserve the name of fellowship, nor will women ever fulfil the peculiar duties of their sex, till they become enlightened citizens, till they become free by being enabled to earn their own / subsistence, independent of men; in the same manner, i mean, to prevent misconstruction, as one man is independent of another. nay, marriage will never be held sacred till women, by being brought up with men, are prepared to be their companions rather than their mistresses; for the mean doublings of cunning will ever render them contemptible, whilst oppression renders them timid. so convinced am i of this truth, that i will venture to predict that virtue will never prevail in society till the virtues of both sexes are founded on reason; and, till the affections common to both are allowed to gain their due strength by the discharge of mutual duties.
