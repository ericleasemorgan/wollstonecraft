where can a tender suffering being fly but to the searcher of hearts? and, when death has desolated the present scene, and torn from us the friend of our youth  when we walk along the accustomed path, and, almost fancying nature dead, ask, where art thou who gave life to these well-known scenes? when memory heightens former pleasures to contrast our present prospects  there is but one source of comfort within our reach;  and in this sublime solitude the world appears to contain only the / creator and the creature, of whose happiness he is the source.  these are human feelings; but i know not of any common nature or common relation amongst men but what results from reason. the common affections and passions equally bind brutes together; and it is only the continuity of those relations that entitles us to the denomination of rational creatures; and this continuity arises from reflection  from the operations of that reason which you contemn with flippant disrespect.
