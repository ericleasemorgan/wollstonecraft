one striking instance of the folly of women must not be omitted.  the manner in which they treat servants in the presence of children, permitting them to suppose that they ought to wait on them, and bear their humours. a child should always be made to receive assistance from a man or woman as a favour; and, as the first lesson of independence, they should practically be taught, by the example of their mother, not to require that personal attendance, which it is an insult to humanity to require, when in health; and instead of being led to assume airs of consequence, / a sense of their own weakness should first make them feel the natural equality of man. yet, how frequently have i indignantly heard servants imperiously called to put children to bed, and sent away again and again, because master or miss hung about mamma, to stay a little longer. thus made slavishly to attend the little idol, all those most disgusting humours were exhibited which characterize a spoiled child.
