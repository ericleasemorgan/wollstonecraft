fully sensible as you must be of the baneful consequences that inevitably follow this notorious infringement on the dearest rights of men, and that it is an infernal blot on the very face of our immaculate constitution, i cannot avoid expressing my surprise that when you recommended our form of government as a model, you did not caution the french against the arbitrary custom of pressing men for the sea service.a you should have hinted to them, that property in england is much more secure than liberty, and not have concealed that the liberty of an honest mechanic  his all  is often sacrificed to secure the property of the rich. for it is a farce to pretend that a man fights for his country, his hearth, or his altars, when he has neither liberty nor property. /  his property is in his nervousb arms  and they are compelled to pull a strange rope at the surly command of a tyrannic boy, who probably obtained his rank on account of his family connections, or the prostituted vote of his father, whose interest in a borough, or voice as a senator, was acceptable to the minister.
