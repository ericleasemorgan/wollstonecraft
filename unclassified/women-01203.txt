who ever drew a more exalted female character than rousseau?a though in the lump he constantly endeavoured to degrade the sex. and why was he thus anxious? truly to justify to himself the affection which weakness and virtue had made him cherish for that fool theresa.b he could not raise her to the common level of her sex; and therefore he laboured to bring woman down to her's. he found her a convenient humble companion, and pride made him determine to find some superiour virtues in the being whom he chose to live with; but did not her conduct during his life, and after his death, clearly shew how / grossly he was mistaken who called her a celestial innocent.c nay, in the bitterness of his heart, he himself laments, that when his bodily infirmities made him no longer treat her like a woman, she ceased to have an affection for him.d and it was very natural that she should, for having so few sentiments in common, when the sexual tie was broken, what was to hold her? to hold her affection whose sensibility was confined to one sex, nay, to one man, it requires sense to turn sensibility into the broad channel of humanity; many women have not mind enough to have an affection for a woman, or a friendship for a man. but the sexual weakness that makes woman depend on man for a subsistence, produces a kind of cattish affection which leads a wife to purr about her husband as she would about any man who fed and caressed her.
