this is contemptible hard-hearted sophistry, in the specious form of humility, and submission to the will of heaven.  it is, sir, possible to render the poor happier in this world, without depriving them of the consolation which you gratuitously grant them in the next. they have a right to more comfort than they at present enjoy; and more comfort might be afforded them, without encroaching on the pleasures of the rich: not now waiting to enquire whether the rich have any right to exclusive pleasures. what do i say?  encroaching! no; if an intercourse were established between them, it would impart the only true pleasure that can be snatched in this land of shadows, this hard school of moral discipline.
