mrs macaulay has justly observed, that 'there is but one fault which a woman of honour may not commit with impunity.'a she then justly and humanely adds  'this has given rise to the trite and foolish observation, that the first fault against chastity in woman has a radical power to deprave the character. but no such frail beings come out of the hands of nature. the human mind is built of nobler materials than to be easily corrupted; and with all their disadvantages of situation and education, women seldom become entirely abandoned till they are thrown into a state of desperation, by the venomous rancour of their own sex.'b
