 'i once knew a young person who learned to write before she learned to read, and began to write with her needle before she could use a pen. at first, indeed, she took it into her head to make no other letter than the o: this letter she was constantly making of all sizes, and always the wrong way. unluckily, one day, as she was intent on this employment, she happened to see herself in the looking-glass; when, taking a dislike to the constrained attitude in which she sat while writing, she threw away her pen, like another pallas, and determined against making the o any more. her brother was also equally averse to writing: it was the confinement, however, and not the constrained attitude, that most disgusted him.' rousseau's emilius.b
