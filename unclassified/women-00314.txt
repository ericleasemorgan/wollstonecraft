may not the same remark be applied to women? nay, the argument may be carried still further, for they are both thrown out of a useful station by the unnatural distinctions established in civilized life. riches and hereditary honours have made cyphers of women to give consequence to the numerical figure; and idleness has produced a mixture of gallantry and despotism into society, which leads the very men who are the slaves of their mistresses to tyrannize over their sisters, wives, and daughters. this is only keeping them in rank and file, it is true. strengthen the female mind by enlarging it, and there will be an end to blind obedience; but, as blind obedience is ever / sought for by power, tyrants and sensualists are in the right when they endeavour to keep women in the dark, because the former only want slaves, and the latter a play-thing. the sensualist, indeed, has been the most dangerous of tyrants, and women have been duped by their lovers, as princes by their ministers, whilst dreaming that they reigned over them.
