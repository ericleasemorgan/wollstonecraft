i am aware of an obvious inference:  from every quarter have i heard exclamations against masculine women; but where are they to be found? if by this appellation men mean to inveigh against their ardour in hunting, shooting, and gaming, i shall most cordially join in the cry; but if it be against the imitation of manly virtues, or, more properly speaking, the attainment of those talents and virtues, the exercise of which ennobles the human character, and which raise females in the scale of animal being, when they are comprehensively termed mankind;  all those who view them with a [philosophic] eye must, i should think, wish with me, that they may every day grow more and more masculine.
