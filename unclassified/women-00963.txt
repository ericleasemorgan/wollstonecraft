superficial moralists had said less respecting behaviour, and outward observances, for unless virtue, of any kind, be built on knowledge, it will only produce a kind of insipid decency. respect for the opinion of the world, has, however, been termed the principal duty of woman in the most express words, for rousseau declares, 'that reputation is no less indispensable than chastity.'a 'a man,' adds he, 'secure in his own good conduct, depends only on himself, and may brave the public opinion: but a woman, in behaving well, performs but half her duty; as what is thought of her, is as important to her as what she really is. it follows hence, that the system of a woman's / education should, in this respect, be directly contrary to that of ours. opinion is the grave of virtue among the men; but its throne among women.'b it is strictly logical to infer that the virtue that rests on opinion is merely worldly, and that it is the virtue of a being to whom reason has been denied. but, even with respect to the opinion of the world, i am convinced that this class of reasoners are mistaken.
