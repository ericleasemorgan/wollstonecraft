in the regulation of a family, in the education of children, understanding, in an unsophisticated sense, is particularly required: strength both of body and mind; yet the men who, by their writings, have most earnestly laboured to domesticate women, have endeavoured, by arguments dictated by a gross appetite, [which] satiety had rendered fastidious, to weaken their bodies and cramp their minds. but, if even by these sinister methods they really persuaded women, by working on their feelings, to stay at home, and fulfil the duties of a mother and mistress of a family, i should cautiously oppose opinions that led women to right conduct, by prevailing on them to make the discharge of [such important duties the main] business of life, though reason were insulted. yet, and i appeal to experience, if by neglecting the understanding they be as much, nay, more detached from these domestic [employments], than they could be by the most serious intellectual pursuit, though it may be observed, that the mass of mankind will never vigorously pursue an intellectual object, i may be allowed to infer that reason / is absolutely necessary to enable a woman to perform any duty properly, and i must again repeat, that sensibility is not reason.
