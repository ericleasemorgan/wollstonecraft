even recommending piety he uses the following argument. 'never, perhaps, does a fine woman strike more deeply, than when, composed into pious recollection, and possessed with the noblest considerations, she assumes, without knowing it, superiour dignity and new graces; so that the beauties of holiness seem to radiate about her, and the by-standers are almost induced to fancy her already worshipping amongst her kindred angels!'d why are women to be thus bred up with a desire of conquest? the very word, used in this sense, gives me a sickly qualm! do religion and virtue offer no stronger motives, no brighter reward? must they always be debased by being made / to consider the sex of their companions? must they be taught always to be pleasing? and when levelling their small artillery at the heart of man, is it necessary to tell them that a little sense is sufficient to render their attention incredibly soothing? 'as a small degree of knowledge entertains in a woman, so from a woman, though for a different reason, a small expression of kindness delights, particularly if she have beauty!'e i should have supposed for the same reason.
