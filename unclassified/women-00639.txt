'here then we see a primary propensity firmly established, which you need only to pursue and regulate. the little creature will doubtless be very desirous to know / how to dress up her doll, to make its sleeve-knots, its flounces, its head-dress, etc. she is obliged to have so much recourse to the people about her, for their assistance in these articles, that it would be much more agreeable to her to owe them all to her own industry. hence we have a good reason for the first lessons that are usually taught these young females: in which we do not appear to be setting them a task, but obliging them, by instructing them in what is immediately useful to themselves. and, in fact, almost all of them learn with reluctance to read and write; but very readily apply themselves to the use of their needles. they imagine themselves already grown up, and think with pleasure that such qualifications will enable them to decorate themselves.'a
