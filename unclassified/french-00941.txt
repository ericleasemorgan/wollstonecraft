have appeared to the kings of europe a dangerous encroachment on their indefeasible rights:  a heresy tending to undermine their privileges, should such audacity pass unchastized, and to destroy the splendour of royalty by presuming to control it's omnipotence. it was then scarcely to be expected, that their resentment would be appeased by shielding the person of louis against the danger of intrigue and violence. it was not, indeed, the preservation of the life of this unfortunate man, that interested them so sensibly as to appall the sycophants of europe.  no; it was the attack made on despotism; and the attempt to draw aside the splendid curtain which concealed it's folly, that threw them into a general ferment and agitation. this agitation could not fail to inspire the court of versailles with hope, and they stood prepared to take advantage of the gathering storm, as / eagerly as a distressed mariner, who has long laid becalmed, perceiving at length a gentle heaving of the sea, and feeling the undulating motion of his bark, foresees the approaching breeze, and spreads his sails to catch the first breath of wind. the effect of the feigned or real pity of many of the admirers of the old system, who were deeply wounded by the wrong done, as they insisted, to their king, was to be dreaded; for it was not to be supposed, that the chivalrous spirit of france would be destroyed in an instant, though swords had ceased to leap out of their scabbardsa when beauty was not deified. it was then undoubtedly to be feared, that they would risk their lives and fortunes to support the glory of their master, and their own notions of honour: and the assembly, by making louis not accountable for any of his actions, however insincere, unjust, or atrocious, was affording all his abettors a shelter, encouraging at the same time his hypocrisy, and relaxing the little energy of character, which his misfortune seemed to be calling into play.
