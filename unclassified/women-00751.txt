the remarks relative to behaviour, though many of them very sensible, i entirely disapprove of, because it appears to me to be beginning, as it were, at the wrong end. a cultivated understanding, and an affectionate heart, will never want starched rules of decorum  something more substantial than seemliness will be the result; and, without understanding / the behaviour here recommended, would be rank affectation. decorum, indeed, is the one thing needful!  decorum is to supplant nature, and banish all simplicity and variety of character out of the female world. yet what good end can all this superficial counsel produce? it is, however, much easier to point out this or that mode of behaviour, than to set the reason to work; but, when the mind has been stored with useful knowledge, and strengthened by being employed, the regulation of the behaviour may safely be left to its guidance.
