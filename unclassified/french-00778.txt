the assembly in this instance seem to have acted with strange confusion of mind, or a total ignorance of the nature of a mixed government: for either the question was nugatory, or a king useless. lally-tolendal, mounier,b and mirabeau, argued for the absolute veto.  'two powers,' says mirabeau, 'are necessary to the existence of the body-politic, in the orderly discharge of it's functions:  to will  and to act. by the first, society establishes the regulations which ought all to conspire to one end  the good of all:  by the second, these regulations are carried into execution; and public authority is exerted, to make society triumph / over the obstacles, which might arise from the opposite wills of individuals. in a great nation, these two powers cannot be exercised by the people: whence comes the necessity of representatives, to exercise the faculty of willing, or the legislative power; and also of another species of representation, to exercise the faculty of acting; or, the executive power.'c
