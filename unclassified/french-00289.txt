to divert the gathering storm from breaking over their heads, the cabal determined to rest all their hopes on the aid of the foreign troops; which they were collecting from different parts of the kingdom, not caring to trust to the french soldiery, who were assuming the character of citizens. mean while, with the usual chicanery of courtiers, they continued to amuse the deputies, till they could crush them at once; and effectually blast the hopes of the people. the human heart is naturally good, though so often the dupe of passion.  for though it's feelings be sophisticated, or stifled; though the head contrives the blackest machinations; even in the silence of solitude, who will whisper to himself that he is a villain? will he not rather try, like milton's devil, to find out a damned plea of necessity, to cover his guilt?  paying homage, in spite of himself, to the eternal justice he violates under the pretext of self-preservation.b but, it is not alone the virtues of man, those changing hues, of which the colour is undecided, that proclaim his native dignity. no; his vices have the same stamp of the / divinity: and it is necessary to pervert the understanding, before the heart can be led astray. men, likewise, indolently adopt the habits of thinking of their day, without weighing them. thus these very courtiers, who could coolly contemplate the massacre, which must be the consequence of assembling the foreign troops, because it was a continuance of the established course of things, have since started, probably with real horrour, from the contemplation of the butcheries, which their very tenacity produced. such is the deceitfulness of the human heart, and so necessary is it to render the head clear to make the principles of action pure.
