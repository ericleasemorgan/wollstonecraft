creature of yesterday: no; she had her share in the grand drama. i guard against misrepresentation; but the man who cannot modify general assertions, has scarcely learned the first rudiments of reasoning. i know that there is a great portion of virtue in the romish church, yet i should not choose to neglect clothing myself with a garment of my own righteousness, depending on a kind donative of works of supererogation. i know that there are many clergymen, of all denominations, wise and virtuous; yet i have not that respect for the whole body, which, you say, characterizes our nation, 'emanating from a certain plainness and directness of understanding.'a  / now we are stumbling on inbred feelings and secret lights again  or, i beg your pardon, it may be the furbished up face which you choose to give to the argument.
