i may be told that great as this enormity is, it only affects a devoted part of the sex  devoted for the salvation of the rest. but, false as every assertion might easily be proved, that recommends the sanctioning a small evil to produce a greater good; the mischief does not stop here, for the moral character, and peace of mind, of the chaster part of the sex, is undermined by the conduct of the very women to whom they allow no refuge from guilt: whom they inexorably consign to the exercise of arts that lure their husbands from them, debauch their sons, and force them, let not modest women start, to assume, in some degree, the same character themselves. for i will venture to assert, that all the causes of female weakness, as well as depravity, which i have already enlarged on, branch out of one grand cause  want of chastity in men.
