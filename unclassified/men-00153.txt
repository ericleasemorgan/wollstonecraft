it is a well-known fact, that when we, the people of england, have a son whom we scarcely know what to do with  we make a clergyman of him.b when a living is in the gift of a family, a son is brought up to the church; but not always with hopes full of immortality. 'such sublime principles are not constantly infused into persons of exalted birth;' they sometimes think of 'the paltry pelf of the moment'  and the vulgar care of preaching the gospel, or practising self-denial, is left to the poor curates, who, arguing on your ground, cannot have, from the scanty stipend they receive, 'very high and worthy notions of their function and destination.'c this consecration for ever; a word, / that from lips of flesh is big with a mighty nothing, has not purged the sacred temple from all the impurities of fraud, violence, injustice, and tyranny. human passions still lurk in her sanctum sanctorum; and, without the profane exertions of reason, vain would be her ceremonial ablutions; morality would still stand aloof from this national religion, this ideal consecration of a state; and men would rather choose to give the goods of their body, when on their death beds, to clear the narrow way to heaven, than restrain the mad career of passions during life.
