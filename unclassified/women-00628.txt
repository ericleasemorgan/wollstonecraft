'whether i consider the peculiar destination of the sex, observe their inclinations, or remark their duties, all things equally / concur to point out the peculiar method of education best adapted to them. woman and man were made for each other; but their mutual dependence is not the same. the men depend on the women only on account of their desires; the women on the men both on account of their desires and their necessities: we could subsist better without them than they without us.'[ ]
