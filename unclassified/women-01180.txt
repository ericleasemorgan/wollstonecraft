i only drop these observations at present, as hints; rather, indeed, as an outline of the plan i mean, than a digested one; but i must add, that i highly approve of one regulation / mentioned in the pamphlet already alluded to, that of making the children and youths independent of the masters respecting punishments. they should be tried by their peers, which would be an admirable method of fixing sound principles of justice in the mind, and might have the happiest effect on the temper, which is very early soured or irritated by tyranny, till it becomes peevishly cunning, or ferociously overbearing.
