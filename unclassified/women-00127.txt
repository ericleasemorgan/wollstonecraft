 i remember a circumstance that once came under my own observation, and raised my indignation. i went to visit a little boy at a school where young children were prepared for a larger one. the master took me into the school-room, etc. but whilst i walked down a broad gravel walk, i could not help observing that the grass grew very luxuriantly on each side of me. i immediately asked the child some questions, and found that the poor boys were not allowed to stir off the walk, and that the master sometimes permitted sheep to be turned in to crop the untrodden grass. the tyrant of this domain used to sit by a window that overlooked the prison yard, and one nook turning from it, where the unfortunate babes could sport freely, he enclosed, and planted it with potatoes. the wife likewise was equally anxious to keep the children in order, lest they should dirty or tear their clothes.
