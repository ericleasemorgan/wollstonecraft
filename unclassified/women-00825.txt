if you mean to secure ease and prosperity on earth as the first consideration, and leave futurity to provide for itself; you act prudently in giving your child an early insight into the weaknesses of his nature. you may not, it is true, make an inkle of him;a but do not imagine that he will stick to more than the letter of the law, who has very early imbibed a mean opinion of human nature; nor will he think it necessary to rise much above the common standard. he may avoid gross vices, because honesty is the best policy; but he will never aim at attaining great virtues. the example of writers and artists will illustrate this remark.
