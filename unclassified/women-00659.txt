the being who patiently endures injustice, and silently bears insults, will soon become unjust, or unable to discern right from wrong. besides, i deny the fact, this is not the true way to form or meliorate the temper; for, as a sex, men have better tempers than women, because they are occupied by pursuits that interest the head as well as the heart; and the steadiness of the head gives a healthy temperature to the heart. people of sensibility have seldom good tempers. the formation of the temper is the cool work of reason, when, as life advances, she mixes with happy art, jarring elements. i never knew a weak or ignorant person who / had a good temper, though that constitutional good humour, and that docility, which fear stamps on the behaviour, often obtains the name. i say behaviour, for genuine meekness never reached the heart or mind, unless as the effect of reflection; and that simple restraint produces a number of peccant humours in domestic life, many sensible men will allow, who find some of these gentle irritable creatures, very troublesome companions.
