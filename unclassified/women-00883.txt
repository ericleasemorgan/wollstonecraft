were women more rationally educated, could they take a more comprehensive view of things, they would be contented to love but once in their lives; and after marriage calmly let passion subside into friendship  into that tender intimacy, which is the best refuge from care; yet is built on such pure, still affections, that idle jealousies would not be allowed to disturb the discharge of the sober duties of life, [or] to engross the thoughts that ought to be otherwise employed. this is a state in which many men live; but few, very few women. and the difference may easily be accounted for, without recurring to a sexual character. men, for whom we are told women / were made, have too much occupied the thoughts of women; and this association has so entangled love with all their motives of action; and, to harp a little on an old string, having been solely employed either to prepare themselves to excite love, or actually putting their lessons in practice, they cannot live without love. but, when a sense of duty, or fear of shame, obliges them to restrain this pampered desire of pleasing beyond certain lengths, too far for delicacy, it is true, though far from criminality, they obstinately determine to love, i speak of the passion, their husbands to the end of the chapter  and then acting the part which they foolishly exacted from their lovers, they become abject woers, and fond slaves.
