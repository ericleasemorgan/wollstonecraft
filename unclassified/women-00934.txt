it may be thought that i lay too great a stress on personal reserve; but it is ever the handmaid of modesty. so that were i to name the graces that ought to adorn beauty, i should instantly exclaim, cleanliness, neatness, and personal reserve. it is obvious, i suppose, that the reserve i mean, has nothing sexual in it, and that i think it equally necessary in both sexes. so necessary, indeed, is that reserve and cleanliness which indolent women too often neglect, that i will venture to affirm that when two or three women live in the same house, the one will be most respected by the male part of the family, who reside with them, leaving love entirely out of the question, who pays this kind of habitual respect to her person./
