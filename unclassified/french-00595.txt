it is impossible, after tracing the horrid conspiracy formed by the court against the / lives and liberty of the people, not to feel the most ineffable contempt for that kind of government, which leaves the happiness of a nation at the mercy of a capricious minister of state. the awful and interesting lesson, which the developement of this treachery afforded, was such as ought to have made an indelible impression on their minds.  it was a lesson, the very thought of which stops for a moment the genial current of the heart.  it was a lesson, that should be reapeated to mankind, to bring home to their very senses a conviction of the lengths to which a depraved and absolute government will go, for the sake of holding fast it's power.  it was, in short, a deduction of experience, which will teach posterity that life, and every thing dear to man, can be secured only by the preservation of liberty.
