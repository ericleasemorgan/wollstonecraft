how much more respectable is the woman who earns her own bread by fulfilling any duty, than the most accomplished beauty!  beauty did i say?  so sensible am i of the beauty of moral loveliness, or the harmonious / propriety that attunes the passions of a well-regulated mind, that i blush at making the comparison; yet i sigh to think how few women aim at attaining this respectability by withdrawing from the giddy whirl of pleasure, or the indolent calm that stupifies the good sort of women it sucks in.
