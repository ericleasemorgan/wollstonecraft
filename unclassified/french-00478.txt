people to approach, who were / demanding arms; and that they, entering with confidence on this invitation, had immediately received a discharge of all the musketry of the fortress. this report, confirmed by the presence of the two wounded men, demonstrated to the committee the perfidy of the troops who guarded the bastille, and the necessity of sending succour to those, who, without order or sufficient force, had commenced the attack. mean time the fury of the people was directed against the mayor, who endeavoured by various subterfuges to appease the rage which had been excited by his vain promises of procuring arms. he had, it is true, several times dispersed the multitude by sending them to different places with orders for arms, where he knew they were not to be found; and now, to silence the suspicions that threatened to break out in some dreadful acts of violence, involving the whole committee in the same destruction, he offered to make one of the third deputation; the second appearing to be detained, to remonstrate with delaunay, and try to prevent an effusion of blood. a drum and colours were ordered to attend them, because it was supposed, that the want of some signal had / prevented the others from executing their commission.
