the female understanding has often been spoken of with contempt, as arriving sooner at maturity than the male. i shall not answer this argument by alluding to the early proofs of reason, as well as genius, in cowley, milton, and pope,a but only appeal to experience to decide whether young men, who are early introduced into company (and examples now abound), do not acquire the same precocity. so notorious is this fact, that the bare mentioning of it must bring before people, who at all mix in the world, the idea of a number of swaggering apes of men, whose understandings are narrowed by being brought into the society of men when they ought to have been spinning a top or twirling a hoop.
