the majority of the nobles, and the minority of the clergy, obeyed this peremptory order, and obsequiously followed the king, like the trained horses of his court. the members of the national assembly, however, remained sitting, preserving a silence, more menacing and terrible, than the i will, or i command, of the cabinet; when the grand master of the ceremonies entered,b and addressing himself to the president, reminded him, in the king's name, of the order given to separate / immediately. the president answered, 'that the assembly was not constituted to receive orders from any person;'c but mirabeau, who thought this reply too tame, started up, and addressing the messenger, said: 'yes; we have heard the intentions which the king has been induced to utter; and you cannot be his organ in this assembly.  you, who have neither seat, nor right to speak, ought not to remind us of his discourse. however, to avoid all equivocation or delay, i declare to you, that if you are charged to make us go from hence, you should demand orders to employ force; for only the bayonet can oblige us to quit our places.'d it is difficult to conceive the ardour inspired by this prompt eloquence. it's fire flew from breast to breast, whilst a whisper ran round, that what mirabeau had just uttered, gave a finishing stroke to the revolution.
