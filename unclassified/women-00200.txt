yet, because i am a woman, i would not lead my readers to suppose that i mean violently to agitate the contested question respecting the equality or inferiority of the sex; but as the subject lies in my way, and i cannot pass it over without subjecting the main tendency of my reasoning to misconstruction, i shall stop a moment to deliver, in a few words, my opinion.  in the government of the physical world it is observable that the female [in point of strength is, in general, inferior to the male. this is the law of nature; and it does not appear to be suspended or abrogated in favour of woman. a degree of physical superiority cannot, therefore,] be denied  and it is a noble prerogative! but not content with this natural pre-eminence, / men endeavour to sink us still lower, merely to render us alluring objects for a moment; and women, intoxicated by the adoration which men, under the influence of their senses, pay them, do not seek to obtain a durable interest in their hearts, or to become the friends of the fellow creatures who find amusement in their society.
