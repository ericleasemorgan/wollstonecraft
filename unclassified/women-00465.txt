i wish to sum up what i have said in a few words, for i here throw down my gauntlet, and deny the existence of sexual virtues, not excepting modesty. for man and woman, truth, if i understand the meaning of the word, must be the same; yet the fanciful female character, so prettily drawn by poets and novelists, demanding the sacrifice of truth and sincerity, virtue becomes a relative idea, having no other foundation than utility, and of that utility men pretend arbitrarily to judge, shaping it to their own convenience.
