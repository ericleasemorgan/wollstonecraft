when i treat of friendship, love, and marriage, it will be found that we materially differ in opinion; i shall not then forestall what i have to observe on these important / subjects; but confine my remarks to the general tenor of them, to that cautious family prudence, to those confined views of partial unenlightened affection, which exclude pleasure and improvement, by vainly wishing to ward off sorrow and error  and by thus guarding the heart and mind, destroy also all their energy.  it is far better to be often deceived than never to trust; to be disappointed in love than never to love; to lose a husband's fondness than forfeit his esteem.
