what were the outrages of a day to these continual miseries? let those sorrows hide their diminished head before the tremendous / mountain of woe that thus defaces our globe! man preys on man; and you mourn for the idle tapestry that decorated a gothic pile, and the dronish bell that summoned the fat priest to prayer. you mourn for the empty pageant of a name, when slavery flaps her wing, and the sick heart retires to die in lonely wilds, far from the abodes of men. did the pangs you felt for insulted nobility, the anguish that rent your heart when the gorgeous robes were torn off the idol human weakness had set up, deserve to be compared with the long-drawn sigh of melancholy reflection, when misery and vice are thus seen to haunt our steps, and swim on the top of every cheering prospect? why is our fancy to be appalled by terrific perspectives of a hell beyond the grave?a  hell stalks abroad;  the lash resounds on the slave's naked sides; and the sick wretch, who can no longer earn the sour bread of unremitting labour, steals to a / ditch to bid the world a long good night  or, neglected in some ostentatious hospital, breathes his last amidst the laugh of mercenary attendants.
