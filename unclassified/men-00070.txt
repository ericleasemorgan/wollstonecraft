when the day was set apart merely to commemorate a political revolution and no stated duty was encroached upon.a i will, however, wave this point, and allow that dr price's zeal may have carried him further than sound reason can justify. i do also most cordially coincide with you, that till we can see the remote consequences of things, present calamities must appear in the ugly form of evil, and excite our commiseration. the good that time slowly educes from them may be hid from mortal eye, or dimly seen; whilst sympathy compels man to feel for man, and almost restrains the hand that would amputate a limb to save the whole body. but, after / making this concession, allow me to expostulate with you, and calmly hold up the glass which will shew you your partial feelings.
