i have, probably, had an opportunity of observing more girls in their infancy than j. j. rousseau  i can recollect my own feelings, and i have looked steadily around me; yet, so far from coinciding with him in opinion respecting the first dawn of the female character, i will venture to affirm, that a girl, whose spirits have not been damped by inactivity, or innocence tainted by false shame, will always be a romp, and the doll will never excite attention unless confinement allows her no alternative. girls and boys, in short, would play harmlessly together, if the distinction of sex was not inculcated long before nature makes any difference.  i will go further, and affirm, as an indisputable fact, that most of the women, in the circle of my / observation, who have acted like rational creatures, or shewn any vigour of intellect, have accidentally been allowed to run wild  as some of the elegant formers of the fair sex would insinuate.
