a constitution is a standard for the people to rally round. it is the pillar of a government, the bond of all social unity and order. the investigation of it's principles makes it a fountain of light; from which issue the rays of reason, that gradually bring forward the mental powers of the whole community. and whenever the wheels of government, like the wheels of any other machine, are found clogged, or do not move in a regular manner, they equally require alteration and improvement: and these improvements will be proportionably perfect as the people become enlightened.
