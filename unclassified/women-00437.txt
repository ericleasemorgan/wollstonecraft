it seems natural for man to search for excellence, and either to trace it in the object that he worships, or blindly to invest it with perfection, as a garment. but what good effect can the latter mode of worship have on the moral conduct of a rational being? he bends to power; he adores a dark cloud, / which may open a bright prospect to him, or burst in angry, lawless fury, on his devoted head  he knows not why. and, supposing that the deity acts from the vague impulse of an undirected will, man must also follow his own, or act according to rules, deduced from principles which he disclaims as irreverent. into this dilemma have both enthusiasts and cooler thinkers fallen, when they laboured to free men from the wholesome restraints which a just conception of the character of god imposes.
