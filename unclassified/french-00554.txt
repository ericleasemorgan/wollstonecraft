taste and refined manners, however, were swept away by hordes of uncivilized adventurers; and in europe, where some of the seeds remained, the state of society slowly / meliorating itself till the seventeenth century, nature seemed as much despised in the arts, as reason in the sciences. the different professions were much more knavish than at present, under the veil of solemn stupidity. every kind of learning, as in the savage state, consisted chiefly in the art of tricking the vulgar, by impressing them with an opinion of powers, that did not exist in nature  the priest was to save their souls without morality; the physician to heal their bodies without medicine; and justice was to be administered by the immediate interposition of heaven:  all was to be done by a charm. nothing, in short, was founded on philosophical principles; and the amusements being barbarous, the manners became formal and ferocious. the cultivation of the mind, indeed, consisted rather in acquiring languages, and loading the memory with facts, than in exercising the judgment; consequently, reason governed neither law, nor legislation; and literature was equally devoid of taste. the people were, strictly speaking, slaves; bound by feudal tenures, and still more oppressive ecclesiastical restraints; the lord of the domain leading them to slaughter, like flocks of sheep; and the ghostly father / drawing the bread out of their mouths by the idlest impositions. the croisades, however, freed many of the vassals; and the reformation, forcing the clergy to take a new stand, and become more moral, and even wiser, produced a change of opinion, that soon appeared in humanizing the manners, though not in improving the different governments.
