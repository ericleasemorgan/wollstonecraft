i do not forget the popular opinion that the grecian statues were not modelled after nature. i mean, not according to the proportions of a particular man; but that beautiful limbs and features were selected from various bodies to form an harmonious whole. this might, in some degree, be true. the fine ideal picture of an exalted imagination might be superiour to the materials which the [statuary] found in nature, and thus it might with propriety be termed rather the model of mankind than of a man. it was not, however, the mechanical selection of limbs and features; but the ebullition of an heated fancy that burst forth, and the fine senses and enlarged / understanding of the artist selected the solid matter, which he drew into this glowing focus.
