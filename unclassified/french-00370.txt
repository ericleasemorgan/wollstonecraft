it is perhaps unnecessary to dwell, for a moment, on the insensibility of the court, and the credulity of the people; as they seem the only clues, that will lead us to a precise discrimination of the causes, which completely annihilated all confidence in the ministers, who have succeeded the directors of those infamous measures, that swept away the whole party; measures which involved thousands of innocent people in the same ruin, and have produced a clamour against the proceedings of the nation, that has obscured the glory of her labours. it is painful to follow, through all their windings, the crimes and follies produced by want of sagacity, and just principles of action. for instance, the sance royale was held on the d, when the king, not deigning to advise, commanded the deputies to repair to their different chambers; and only four days after he implored the nobility and clergy to wave every consideration, and accede to the wish of the people. acting in this contradictory manner, it is clear, that the cabal / thought only of rendering sure the decided blow, which was to level with the dust the power, that extorted such humiliating concessions.
