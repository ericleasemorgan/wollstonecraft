why cannot large estates be divided into small farms? these dwellings would indeed grace our land. why are huge forests still allowed to stretch out with idle pomp and all the indolence of eastern grandeur? why does the brown waste meet the traveller's view, when men want work? but commons cannot be enclosed without acts of parliament to increase the property of the rich!a why might not the industrious peasant be allowed to steal a farm from the heath? this sight i have seen;  the cow that supported the children grazed near the hut, and the cheerful poultry were fed by the chubby babes, who breathed / a bracing air, far from the diseases and the vices of cities. domination blasts all these prospects; virtue can only flourish amongst equals, and the man who submits to a fellow-creature, because it promotes his worldly interest, and he who relieves only because it is his duty to lay up a treasure in heaven,b are much on a par, for both are radically degraded by the habits of their life.
