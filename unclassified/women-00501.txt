i lament that women are systematically degraded by receiving the trivial attentions, which men think it manly to pay to the sex, when, in fact, they are insultingly supporting their own superiority. it is not condescension to bow to an inferior. so ludicrous, in fact, do these ceremonies appear to me, / that i scarcely am able to govern my muscles, when i see a man start with eager, and serious solicitude, to lift a handkerchief, or shut a door, when the lady could have done it herself, had she only moved a pace or two.
