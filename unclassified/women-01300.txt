an immoderate fondness for dress, for pleasure, and for sway,a are the passions of savages; the passions that occupy those uncivilized beings who have not yet extended the dominion / of the mind, or even learned to think with the energy necessary to concatenate that abstract train of thought which produces principles. and that women from their education and the present state of civilized life, are in the same condition, cannot, i think, be controverted. to laugh at them then, or satirize the follies of a being who is never to be allowed to act freely from the light of her own reason, is as absurd as cruel; for, that they who are taught blindly to obey authority, will endeavour cunningly to elude it, is most natural and certain.
