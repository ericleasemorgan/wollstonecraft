are we to seek for the rights of men in the ages when a few marks were the only penalty imposed for the life of a man, and death for death when the property of the rich was touched? when  i blush to discover the depravity of our nature  when a deer was killed! are these the laws that it is natural to love, and sacrilegious to invade?  were the rights of men understood when the law authorized or tolerated murder?  or is power and right the same in your creed?/
