this history, taking in such a variety of facts and opinions, has grown under my hand; especially as in writing i cannot avoid entering into some desultory disquisitions, and descriptions of manners and things which, though not strictly necessary to elucidate the events, are intimately connected with the main object; i have also been led into several theoretical investigations, whilst marking the political effects that naturally flow from the progress of knowledge. it is probable, therefore, that this work will be extended to two or three more volumes, a considerable part of which is already written.a/
