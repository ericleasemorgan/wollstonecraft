the man, who, in his ardour for virtue, would banish all the soft arts of peace, and almost carry us back to spartan discipline? is this the man who delights to paint the useful struggles of passion, the triumphs / of good dispositions, and the heroic flights which carry the glowing soul out of itself?  how are these mighty sentiments lowered when he describes the pretty foot and enticing airs of his little favourite! but, for the present, i wave the subject, and, instead of severely reprehending the transient effusions of overweening sensibility, i shall only observe, that whoever has cast a benevolent eye on society, must often have been gratified by the sight of humble mutual love, not dignified by sentiment, [or] strengthened by a union in intellectual pursuits. the domestic trifles of the day have afforded matters for cheerful converse, and innocent caresses have softened toils which did not require great exercise of mind or stretch of thought: yet, has not the sight of this moderate felicity excited more tenderness than respect? an emotion similar to what we feel when children are playing, or animals sporting, whilst the contemplation / of the noble struggles of suffering merit has raised admiration, and carried our thoughts to that world where sensation will give place to reason.
