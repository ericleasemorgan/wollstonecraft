these women are often amiable; and their hearts are really more sensible to general benevolence, more alive to the sentiments that civilize life, than the square-elbowed family drudge; but, wanting a due proportion of reflection and self-government, they only inspire love; and are the mistresses of their husbands, whilst they have any hold on their affections; and the platonic friends of his male acquaintance. these are the fair defects in nature; the women who appear to be created not to enjoy the fellowship of man, but / to save him from sinking into absolute brutality, by rubbing off the rough angles of his character; and by playful dalliance to give some dignity to the appetite that draws him to them.  gracious creator of the whole human race! hast thou created such a being as woman, who can trace thy wisdom in thy works, and feel that thou alone art by thy nature exalted above her,  for no better purpose?  can she believe that she was only made to submit to man, her equal, a being, who, like her, was sent into the world to acquire virtue?  can she consent to be occupied merely to please him; merely to adorn the earth, when her soul is capable of rising to thee?  and can she rest supinely dependent on man for reason, when she ought to mount with him the arduous steeps of knowledge?
