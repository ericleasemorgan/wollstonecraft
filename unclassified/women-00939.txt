as a sex, women are habitually indolent; and every thing tends to make them so. i do not forget the spurts of activity which sensibility produces; but as these flights of feelings only increase the evil, they are not to be confounded with the slow, orderly walk of reason. so great in reality is their mental and bodily indolence, that till their body be strengthened and their understanding enlarged by active exertions, there is little reason to expect that modesty will take place of bashfulness. they may find it prudent to assume its semblance; but the fair veil will only be worn on gala days.
