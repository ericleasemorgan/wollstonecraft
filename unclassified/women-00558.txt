a man of sense can only love such a woman on account of her sex, and respect her, because she is a trusty servant. he lets her, to preserve his own peace, scold the servants, and go to church in clothes made of the very best materials. a man of her own size of understanding would, probably, not agree so well with her; for he might wish to encroach on her prerogative, and manage some domestic concerns himself. yet women, whose minds are not enlarged by cultivation, or the natural selfishness of sensibility expanded by reflection, are very unfit to manage a family; for, by an undue stretch of power, they are always tyrannizing / to support a superiority that only rests on the arbitrary distinction of fortune. the evil is sometimes more serious, and domestics are deprived of innocent indulgences, and made to work beyond their strength, in order to enable the notable woman to keep a better table, and outshine her neighbours in finery and parade. if she attend to her children, it is, in general, to dress them in a costly manner  and, whether this attention arise from vanity or fondness, it is equally pernicious.
