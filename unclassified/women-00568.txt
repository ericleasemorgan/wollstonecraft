mankind seem to agree that children should be left under the management of women during their childhood. now, from all the observation / that i have been able to make, women of sensibility are the most unfit for this task, because they will infallibly, carried away by their feelings, spoil a child's temper. the management of the temper, the first, and most important branch of education, requires the sober steady eye of reason; a plan of conduct equally distant from tyranny and indulgence: yet these are the extremes that people of sensibility alternately fall into; always shooting beyond the mark. i have followed this train of reasoning much further, till i have concluded, that a person of genius is the most improper person to be employed in education, public or private. minds of this rare species see things too much in masses, and seldom, if ever, have a good temper. that habitual cheerfulness, termed good-humour, is, perhaps, as seldom united with great mental powers, as with strong feelings. and those people who follow, with interest and admiration, the flights of genius; or, with cooler approbation suck in the instruction which has been elaborately prepared for them by the profound thinker, ought not to be disgusted, if they find the former choleric, and the latter morose; because liveliness of fancy, and / a tenacious comprehension of mind, are scarcely compatible with that pliant urbanity which leads a man, at least, to bend to the opinions and prejudices of others, instead of roughly confronting them.
