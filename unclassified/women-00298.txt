to prevent any misconstruction, i must add, that i do not believe that a private education can work the wonders which some sanguine writers have attributed to it. men and women must be educated, in a great degree, by the opinions and manners of the / society they live in. in every age there has been a stream of popular opinion that has carried all before it, and given a family character, as it were, to the century. it may then fairly be inferred, that, till society be differently constituted, much cannot be expected from education. it is, however, sufficient for my present purpose to assert, that, whatever effect circumstances have on the abilities, every being may become virtuous by the exercise of its own reason; for if but one being was created with vicious inclinations, that is positively bad, what can save us from atheism? or if we worship a god, is not that god a devil?
