there is a homely proverb, which speaks a shrewd truth, that whoever the devil finds idle he will employ. and what but habitual idleness can hereditary wealth and titles produce? for man is so constituted that he can only attain a proper use of his faculties by exercising them, and will not exercise them unless necessity, of some kind, first set the wheels in motion. virtue likewise can only be acquired by the discharge of relative duties; but the importance of these sacred duties will scarcely be felt by the being who is cajoled out of his humanity by the flattery of sycophants. there must be more equality established in society, or morality will never gain ground, and this virtuous equality will not rest firmly even when founded on a rock, if one half of mankind [be] chained to its bottom by fate, for they will be continually undermining it through ignorance or pride.
