nothing, indeed, can be more irreverent than the cathedral service as it is now performed / in this country, [neither] does it contain a set of weaker men than those who are the slaves of this childish routine. a disgusting skeleton of the former state is still exhibited; but all the solemnity that interested the imagination, if it did not purify the heart, is stripped off. the performance of high mass on the continent must impress every mind, where a spark of fancy glows, with that awful melancholy, that sublime tenderness, so near akin to devotion. i do not say that these devotional feelings are of more use, in a moral sense, than any other emotion of taste; but i contend that the theatrical pomp which gratifies our senses, is to be preferred to the cold parade that insults the understanding without reaching the heart.
