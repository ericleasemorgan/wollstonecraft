when we hear of some daring crime  it comes full on us in the deepest shade of turpitude, and raises indignation; but the eye that gradually saw the darkness thicken, must observe it with more compassionate forbearance. the world cannot be seen by an unmoved spectator, we must mix in the throng, and feel as men feel before we can judge of their feelings. if we mean, in short, to live in the world to grow wiser and better, and not merely to enjoy the good things of life, we must attain a knowledge of others at the same time that we become acquainted with ourselves  knowledge acquired any other way / only hardens the heart and perplexes the understanding.
