tell me, ye who have studied the human mind, is it not a strange way to fix principles by showing young people that they are seldom stable? and how can they be fortified by habits when they are proved to be fallacious by example? why is the ardour of youth thus to be damped, and the luxuriancy of fancy cut to the quick? this dry caution may, it is true, guard a character from worldly mischances; but will infallibly preclude excellence in either virtue or knowledge. the stumbling-block thrown across every path by suspicion, will prevent any vigorous exertions of genius or benevolence, and life will be stripped of its most alluring charm long before its calm evening, when man should retire to contemplation for comfort and support.
