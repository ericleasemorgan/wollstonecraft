the fact is, that men expect from education, what education cannot give. a sagacious parent or tutor may strengthen the body and sharpen the instruments by which the child is to gather knowledge; but the honey must be the reward of the individual's own industry. it is almost as absurd to attempt to make a youth wise by the experience of another, as to expect the body to grow strong by the exercise which is only talked of, or seen. many of those children whose conduct has been most narrowly watched, become the weakest men, because / their instructors only instill certain notions into their minds, that have no other foundation than their authority; and if they [be] loved or respected, the mind is cramped in its exertions and wavering in its advances. the business of education in this case, is only to conduct the shooting tendrils to a proper pole; yet after laying precept upon precept, without allowing a child to acquire judgment itself, parents expect them to act in the same manner by this borrowed fallacious light, as if they had illuminated it themselves; and be, when they enter life, what their parents are at the close. they do not consider that the tree, and even the human body, does not strengthen its fibres till it has reached its full growth.
