he advises them to cultivate a fondness for dress, because a fondness for dress, he asserts, is natural to them.a i am unable to comprehend what either he or rousseau mean, when they frequently use this indefinite term. if they told us that in a pre-existent state the soul was fond of dress, and brought this inclination with it into a new body, i should listen to them with a half smile, as i often do when i hear a rant about innate elegance.  but if he only meant to say that the exercise of the faculties will produce this fondness  i deny it. it is not natural; but arises, like false ambition in men, from a love of power.
