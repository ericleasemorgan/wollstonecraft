 children very early see cats with their kittens, birds with their young ones, etc. why then are they not to be told that their mothers carry and nourish them in the same way? as there would then be no appearance of mystery they would never think of the subject more. truth may always be told to children, if it be told gravely; but it is the immodesty of affected modesty, that does all the mischief; and this smoke heats the imagination by vainly endeavouring to obscure certain objects. if, indeed, children could be kept entirely from improper company, we should never allude to any such subjects; but as this is impossible, it is best to tell them the truth, especially as such information, not interesting them, will make no impression on their imagination.
