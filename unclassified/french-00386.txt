the french nobility, perhaps, the most corrupt and ignorant set of men in the world, except in those objects of taste, which consist in giving variety to amusement, had never lived under the control of any law, but the authority of the king; and having only to dread the bastille for a little time, should they commit any enormity, could not patiently brook the restraints, the better government of the whole society required. haughtily then disregarding the suggestions of humanity, and / even prudence, they determined to subvert every thing, sooner than resign their privileges; and this tenacity will not appear astonishing, if we call to mind, that they considered the people as beasts of burden, and trod them under foot with the mud. this is not a figure of rhetoric; but a melancholy truth! for it is notorious, that, in the narrow streets of paris, where there are no footways to secure the walkers from danger, they were frequently killed, without slackening, by the least emotion of fellow-feeling, the gallop of the thoughtless being, whose manhood was buried in a factitious character.
