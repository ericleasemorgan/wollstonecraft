the precious metals have been considered as the best of all possible signs of value, to facilitate the exchange of commodities, to supply our reciprocal wants: and they will ever be necessary to our comfort, whilst by the common consent of mankind they are the standards of exchange. gold and silver have a specific value, because it is not easy to accumulate them beyond a certain quantity. paper, on the contrary, is a dangerous expedient, except under a well established government: and / even then the business ought to be conducted with great moderation and sagacity.  perhaps it would be wise, that it's extent should be consisent with the commerce of the country, and the quantity of species actually in it  but it is the spirit of commerce to stretch credit too far. the notes, also, which are issued by a state before it's government is well established, will certainly be depreciated; and in proportion as they grow precarious, the gold and silver, which was formerly in circulation will vanish, and every article of trade, and all the comforts of life, will bear a higher price.
