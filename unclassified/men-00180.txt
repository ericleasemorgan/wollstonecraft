it is not, perhaps, of very great consequence who were the founders of a state; savages, thieves, curates, or practitioners in the law. it is true, you might sarcastically remark, that the romans had always a smack of the old leaven, and that the private robbers, supposing the tradition to be true, only became / public depredators. you might have added, that their civilization must have been very partial, and had more influence on the manners than morals of the people; or the amusements of the amphitheatre would not have remained an everlasting blot not only on their humanity, but on their refinement, if a vicious elegance of behaviour and luxurious mode of life is not a prostitution of the term. however, the thundering censures which you have cast with a ponderous arm, and the more playful bushfiring of ridicule, are not arguments that will ever depreciate the national assembly, for applying to their understanding rather than to their imagination, when they met to settle the newly acquired liberty of the state on a solid foundation.
