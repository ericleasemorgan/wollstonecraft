a wild wish has just flown from my heart to my head, and i will not stifle it though it may excite a horse-laugh.  i do earnestly wish to see the distinction of sex confounded in society, unless where love animates the behaviour. for this distinction is, i am firmly persuaded, the foundation of the weakness of character ascribed to woman; is the cause why the understanding is neglected, whilst accomplishments are acquired with sedulous care: and the same cause accounts for their preferring the graceful before the heroic virtues.
