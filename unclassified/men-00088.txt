who can recount all the unnatural crimes which the laudable, interesting desire of perpetuating a name has produced? the younger children have been sacrificed to the eldest son; sent into exile, or confined in convents, that they might not encroach on what was called, with shameful falsehood, the family estate. will mr burke call this parental affection reasonable or virtuous?  no; it is the spurious offspring of over-weening, mistaken pride  and not that first source of civilization, natural parental affection, that makes no difference between child and child, but what reason justifies by pointing out superior merit.
