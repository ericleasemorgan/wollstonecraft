i am aware that this argument would carry me further than it may be supposed i wish to go; but i follow truth, and, still adhering to my first position, i will allow that bodily strength seems to give man a natural superiority over woman; and this is the only solid basis on which the superiority of the sex can be built. but i still insist, that not only the virtue, but the knowledge of the two sexes should be the same in nature, if not in degree, and that women, considered not only as moral, but rational creatures, ought to endeavour to acquire human virtues (or perfections) by the same means as men, instead of being educated like a fanciful kind of half being  one of rousseau's wild chimeras. /
