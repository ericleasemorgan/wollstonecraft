some blamed the decrees, which, said they, have sacrificed the property of several / thousand families to the vain desire of popularity.  others complained of the neglect of those forms, by which every assembly, that aspires at putting some maturity into it's decrees, ought to direct it's debates;  they disapproved of an afternoon sitting;  of the rapid succession of subjects, not allowing time for any to be weighed;  of the multiplicity of them;  and of the continual acclamations, which rendered a calm discussion physically impossible.  'what!' they continued, 'shall the most important business always be treated with the levity, which characterized us before we deserved to be termed a nation? eternally the sport of our vivacity, a happy turn decides with us the most serious point; and gay sallies are ever our substitutes for arguments.  we do madly the wisest things; and even our reason is always connected by some filament or other to inconsistency.  the national assembly had been a long time reproached for dwelling on trifling objects; and not attending sufficiently to the promotion of general good.  when suddenly  in a single night, more than twenty important laws are decided by an uproar. so much done, in / such a short time, is so astonishing, that it appears like a dream.'a
