the complication of laws in every country has tended to bewilder the understanding of man in the science of government; and whilst artful politicians have taken advantage of the ignorance or credulity of their fellow citizens, it was impossible to prevent a degeneracy of morals, because impunity will always be a stimulus to the passions. this has been the cause of the insincerity, which has so long disgraced the courts of europe, and pervading every class of men in their offices or employ, has extended it's poison throughout the higher orders of society; and it will require a simplification of laws, an establishment of equal / rights, and the responsibility of ministers, to secure a just and enlightened policy. but till this be effected, it ought not to surprize us, should we hear the mock patriots of the day declaiming about public reform, merely to answer sinister purposes; or should we chance to discover, that the most extolled characters have been actuated by a miserable selfishness, or prompted by corroding resentment, to exertions for the public good; whilst historians have ignorantly attributed the political advantages, which have been attained by a gradual improvement of manners, to their resolution, and the virtuous exercise of their talents.
