vicious indolence and inactivity, which we falsely call delicacy; instead of hardening their / minds by the severer principles of reason and philosophy, we breed them to useless arts, which terminate in vanity and sensuality. in most of the countries which i had visited, they are taught nothing of an higher nature than a few modulations of the voice, or useless postures of the body; their time is consumed in sloth or trifles, and trifles become the only pursuits capable of interesting them. we seem to forget, that it is upon the qualities of the female sex that our own domestic comforts and the education of our children must depend. and what are the comforts or the education which a race of beings, corrupted from their infancy, and unacquainted with all the duties of life, are fitted to bestow? to touch a musical instrument with useless skills, to exhibit their natural or affected graces to the eyes of indolent and debauched young men, to dissipate their husband's patrimony in riotous and unnecessary expences, these are the only arts cultivated by women in most of the polished nations i had seen. and the consequences are uniformly such as may be expected to proceed from such polluted sources, private misery and public servitude.
