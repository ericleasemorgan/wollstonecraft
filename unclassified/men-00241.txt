it may be confidently asserted that no man chooses evil, because it is evil; he only mistakes it for happiness, the good he seeks. and the desire of rectifying these mistakes, is the / noble ambition of an enlightened understanding, the impulse of feelings that philosophy invigorates. to endeavour to make unhappy men resigned to their fate, is the tender endeavour of short-sighted benevolence, of transient yearnings of humanity; but to labour to increase human happiness by extirpating error, is a masculine godlike affection. this remark may be carried still further. men who possess uncommon sensibility, whose quick emotions shew how closely the eye and heart are connected, soon forget the most forcible sensations. not tarrying long enough in the brain to be subject to reflection, the next sensations, of course, obliterate them. memory, however, treasures up these proofs of native goodness; and the being who is not spurred on to any virtuous act, still thinks itself of consequence, and boasts of its feelings. why? because the sight of distress, or an affecting narrative, made its blood flow with more velocity, and the / heart, literally speaking, beat with sympathetic emotion. we ought to beware of confounding mechanical instinctive sensations with emotions that reason deepens, and justly terms the feelings of humanity. this word discriminates the active exertions of virtue from the vague declamation of sensibility.
