with respect to that anxiety to preserve a reputation hardly earned, which leads sagacious people to analyze it, i shall not make the obvious comment; but i am afraid that morality is very insidiously undermined, in the female world, by the attention being turned to the shew instead of the substance. a simple thing is thus made strangely complicated; nay, sometimes virtue and its shadow are set at variance. we should never, perhaps, have heard of lucretia, had she died to preserve her chastity instead of her reputation.a if we really deserve our own good opinion we shall commonly be respected in the world; but if we pant after higher improvement and higher attainments, it is not sufficient to view ourselves as we suppose that we are viewed by others, though this has been ingeniously argued, as the foundation of our moral sentiments. because each by-stander may have his own prejudices, beside the prejudices of his age or country. we should rather endeavour to view ourselves as we suppose that being views us who seeth each thought ripen into action, and whose judgment never / swerves from the eternal rule of right. righteous are all his judgments  just as merciful!
