women of quality seldom do any of the manual part of their dress, consequently only their taste is exercised, and they acquire, by thinking less of the finery, when the business of their toilet is over, that ease, which seldom appears in the deportment of women, who dress merely for the sake of dressing. in fact, the observation with respect to the middle rank, the one in which talents thrive best, extends not to women; for those of the superior class, by catching, at least, a smattering of literature, and conversing more with men, on general topics, acquire more knowledge than the women who ape their fashions and faults without sharing their advantages. with respect to virtue, to use the word in a comprehensive sense, i have seen most in low life. many poor women maintain their children by the sweat of their brow, and keep together families that the vices of the fathers would have scattered abroad; but gentlewomen are too indolent to be actively virtuous, and are softened rather than refined by civilization. indeed, the good sense which i have met with, among the poor women who have had few advantages of education, and yet have acted heroically, strongly confirmed / me in the opinion that trifling employments have rendered woman a trifler. man, taking her body, the mind is left to rust; so that while physical love enervates man, as being his favourite recreation, he will endeavour to enslave woman:  and, who can tell, how many generations may be necessary to give vigour to the virtue and talents of the freed posterity of abject slaves?
