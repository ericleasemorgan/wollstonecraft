but to view the subject in another point of view. do passive indolent women make the best wives? confining our discussion to the present moment of existence, let us see how such weak creatures perform their part? do the women who, by the attainment of a few superficial accomplishments, have strengthened the prevailing prejudice, merely contribute to the happiness of their husbands? do they display their charms merely to amuse them? and have women, who have early imbibed / notions of passive obedience, sufficient character to manage a family or educate children? so far from it, that, after surveying the history of woman, i cannot help, agreeing with the severest satirist, considering the sex as the weakest as well as the most oppressed half of the species. what does history disclose but marks of inferiority, and how few women have emancipated themselves from the galling yoke of sovereign man?  so few, that the exceptions remind me of an ingenious conjecture respecting newton: that he was probably a being of a superior order, accidently caged in a human body.c [following the same train of thinking], i have been led to imagine that the few extraordinary women who have rushed in eccentrical directions out of the orbit prescribed to their sex, were [male spirits, confined by mistake in female frames]. but if it be not philosophical to think of sex when the soul is mentioned, the inferiority must depend on the organs; or the heavenly fire, which is to ferment the clay, is not given in equal portions.
