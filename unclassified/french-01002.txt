the national troops were eager to convince the mob, that they were equally offended at the disrespect paid to the emblem of liberty; and the flemish regiment, though they were in battle array, made the women let their rings drop into their guns, to be convinced that they were not charged: saying, 'it was true, they had drunk the wine of the body guards; but what did that engage them to do? they had also cried, vive le roi, as the people themselves did every day; and it was their intention to serve them faithfully, but not against the nation!'  with other speeches to the same effect;  adding, 'that one of their officers had ordered a thousand cockades; and they knew not why / they were not distributed!' enraged by the tenour of this discourse, a body-guard's man struck one of the soldiers talking thus, who, in return, fired on him, and fractured his arm. all was now confusion; and every thing tended to render the body guards more odious to the populace.
