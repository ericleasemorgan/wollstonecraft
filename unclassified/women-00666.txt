'daughters should be always submissive; their mothers, however, should not be inexorable. to make a young person tractable, she ought not to be made unhappy, to make her modest she ought not to be rendered stupid. on the contrary, i should not be displeased at her being permitted to use some art, not to elude punishment in case of disobedience, but to exempt herself from the necessity of obeying. it is not necessary to make her dependence burdensome, but only to let her feel it. subtilty is a talent natural to the sex; and, as i am persuaded, all our natural inclinations are right and good in themselves, i am of opinion this should be cultivated as well as the others: it is requisite for us only to prevent its abuse.'a
