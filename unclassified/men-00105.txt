'on this scheme of things a king is but a man; a queen is but a woman; a woman is but an animal, and an animal not of the highest order.'  all true, sir; if she is not more attentive to the duties of humanity than queens and fashionable ladies in general are. i will still further accede to the opinion you have so justly conceived of the spirit which begins to animate this age.  'all homage paid to the sex in general, as such, and without distinct views, is to be regarded as romance and folly.' undoubtedly; because such homage vitiates them, prevents their endeavouring to obtain solid personal merit; and, in short, makes those beings vain inconsiderate dolls, who ought to be prudent mothers and useful members of society. 'regicide and sacrilege are but fictions of superstition / corrupting jurisprudence, by destroying its simplicity. the murder of a king, or a queen, or a bishop, are only common homicide.'a  again i agree with you; but you perceive, sir, that by leaving out the word father, i think the whole extent of the comparison invidious.
