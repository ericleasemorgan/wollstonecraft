contemplating then these stupendous events with the cool eye of observation, the judgement, / difficult to be preserved unwraped under the pressure of the calamitous horrours produced by desperate and enraged factions, will continually perceive that it is the uncontaminated mass of the french nation, whose minds begin to grasp the sentiments of freedom, that has secured the equilibrium of the state; often tottering on the brink of annihilation; in spite of the folly, selfishness, madness, treachery, and more fatal mock patriotism, the common result of depraved manners, the concomitant of that servility and voluptuousness which for so long a space of time has embruted the higher orders of this celebrated nation.at this glorious era, the toleration of religious opinions in america, which the spirit of the times, when that continent was peopled / with persecuted europeans, produced, aided, not a little, to diffuse these rational sentiments, and exhibited the phenomenon of a government established on the basis of reason and equality. the eyes of all europe were watchfully fixed on the practical success of this experiment in political science; and whilst the crowns of the old world were drawing into their focus the hard-earned recompence of the toil and care of the simple citizens, who lived detached from courts, deprived of the comforts of life, the just reward of industry, or, palsied by oppression, pined in dirt and idleness; the anglo-americans appeared to be another race of beings, men formed to enjoy the advantages of society, and not merely to benefit those who governed; the use to which they had been appropriated in almost every state; considered only as the ballast which keeps the vessel steady, necessary, yet despised. so conspicuous in fact was the difference, that, when frenchmen became the auxiliaries of those brave people, during their noble struggle against the tyrannical and inhuman ambition of the british court, it imparted to them that stimulus, which alone was wanting to give wings to freedom, who, hovering over france, / led her indignant votaries to wreak their vengeance on the tottering fabric of a government, the foundation of which had been laid by benighted ignorance, and it's walls cemented by the calamities of millions that mock calculation  and, in it's ruins a system was entombed, the most baneful to human happiness and virtue.the court, for i consider the government, at this period, completely at an end, continued to stumble out of one blunder into another, till at last they rested all their hopes on the popular reforms projected by brienne, in conjunction with lamoignon, a man with more strength of character, to cajole the people and crush the parliament. several strokes, the feeble blows of angry men, who wished still to retain the stolen sweets of office, were aimed at this body, calculated to mislead the people, who / were also promised a reformed code of penal laws. but the time when partial remedies would have been eagerly swallowed was past, and the people saw distinctly, that their will would soon be law, and their power omnipotent. but the minister, brienne, not aware of this, to steer clear of further opposition, proposed the plan of a cour plniere:b an heterogeneous assembly of princes, nobles, magistrates, and soldiers. a happy substitute, as he imagined, for the parliament; and which, by restoring the ancient forms of the kings of france, would awe and amuse the people. he did not consider, that their minds were now full of other objects, and their enthusiasm turned into another channel.the social contract of rousseau, and his admirable work on the origin of the inequalities amongst mankind, had been in the hands of all france, and admired by many, who could not enter into the depth of the reasoning.b / in short, they were learned by heart, by those whose heads could not comprehend the chain of argument, though they were sufficiently clear to seize the prominent ideas, and act up to their conviction. perhaps, the great advantage of eloquence is, that, impressing the results of thinking on minds alive only to emotion, it gives wings to the slow foot of reason, and fire to the cold labours of investigation: yet it is observable, that, in proportion as the understanding is cultivated, the mind grows attached to the exercise of investigation, and the combination of abstract ideas. the nobles of france had also read these writings for amusement; but they left not on their minds traces of conviction sufficiently strong to overcome those prejudices self-interest rendered so dear, that they easily persuaded themselves of their reasonableness. the nobility and clergy, with all their dependents under the influence of the same sentiments, formed a considerable proportion of the nation, on the rest of which they looked down with contempt, considering them as merely the grass of the land, necessary to clothe nature; yet only fit to be trodden under foot. but these despised / people were beginning to feel their real consequence, and repeated with emphasis the happy comparison of the abb seiyes, 'that the nobility are like vegetable tumours, which cannot exist without the sap of the plants they exhaust.'c nevertheless, in treating with the nobles, the angles of pride, which time alone could have smoothed silently away, were, perhaps, too rudely knocked off, for the folly of distinctions was rapidly wearing itself out, and would probably have melted gradually before the rational opinions, that were continually gaining ground,speaking of edward the iiid. hume observes, that 'he was a prince of great capacity, not governed by favourites, not led astray by any unruly passion, sensible that nothing could be more essential to his interests than to keep on good terms with his people: yet, on the whole, it appears that the government, at best, was only a barbarous monarchy, not regulated by any fixed maxims, or bounded by any certain or undisputed rights,b which in practice were regularly observed. the king / conducted himself by one set of principles; the barons by another; the commons by a third; the clergy by a fourth. all these systems of government were opposite and incompatible: each of them prevailed in its turn, as incidents were favourable to it: a great prince rendered the monarchical power predominant: the weakness of a king gave reins to the aristocracy: a superstitious age saw the clergy triumphant:blackstone, to whom mr burke pays great deference,a seems to agree with dr price, that the succession of the king of great britain depends on the choice of the people, or that / they have a power to cut it off; but this power, as you have fully proved, has been cautiously exerted, and might with more propriety be termed a right than a power. be it so!  yet when you elaborately cited precedents to shew that our forefathers paid great respect to hereditary claims, you might have gone back to your favourite epoch, and shewn their respect for a church that fulminating laws have since loaded with opprobrium. the preponderance of inconsistencies, when weighed with precedents, should lessen the most bigotted veneration for antiquity, and force men / of the eighteenth century to acknowledge, that our canonized forefathers were unable, or afraid, to revert to reason, without resting on the crutch of authority; and should not be brought as a proof that their children are never to be allowed to walk alone.a brutal attachment to children has appeared most conspicuous in parents who have treated them like slaves, and demanded due homage for all the property they transferred to them, during their lives. it has led them to force their children to break the most sacred ties; to do violence to a natural impulse, and run into legal prostitutionb to increase wealth or shun poverty; and, still worse, the dread of parental malediction has made many weak characters violate truth in the face of heaven; and, to avoid a father's angry curse, the most sacred promises have been broken. it appears to be a natural suggestion of reason, that a man should be freed from implicit obedience to parents and private punishments, when he is of an age to be subject to the jurisdiction of the laws of his country; and that the barbarous cruelty of allowing parents to imprison their children, to prevent their contaminating their noble blood by following the / dictates of nature when they chose to marry, or for any misdemeanor that does not come under the cognizance of public justice, is one of the most arbitrary violations of liberty.cit is to this instinct, without doubt, that you allude, when you talk of the 'moral constitution of the heart.' to it, i allow, for i consider it as a congregate of sensations / and passions, poets must apply, 'who have to deal with an audience not yet graduated in the school of the rights of men.'a they must, it is clear, often cloud the understanding, whilst they move the heart by a kind of mechanical spring; but that 'in the theatre the first intuitive glance'b of feeling should discriminate the form of truth, and see her fair proportion, i must beg leave to doubt. sacred be the feelings of the heart! concentred in a glowing flame, they become the sun of life; and, without his invigorating impregnation, reason would probably lie in helpless inactivity, and never bring forth her only legitimate offspring  virtue. but to prove that virtue is really an acquisition of the individual, and not the blind impulse of unerring instinct, the bastard vice has often been begotten by the same father.besides, i cannot help suspecting that, if you had the enlightened respect for yourself, which you affect to despise, you would not have said that the constitution of our church and state, formed, like most other modern ones, by degrees, as europe was emerging out of barbarism, was formed 'under the auspices, and was confirmed by the sanctions, of religion and piety.'a you have turned over the historic page; have been hackneyed in the ways of men, and must know that private cabals and public feuds, private virtues and vices, religion and superstition, have all concurred to foment the mass and swell it to its present form; nay more, that it in part owes / its sightly appearance to bold rebellion and insidious innovation. factions, sir, have been the leaven, and private interest has produced public good.besides, the custom of sending clergymen to travel with their noble pupils, as humble companions, instead of exalting, tends inevitably to degrade the clerical character: it is notorious that they meanly submit to the most servile dependence, and gloss over the most capricious follies, to use a soft phrase, of the boys to whom they look up for preferment. an airy mitre dances before them, and they wrap their sheep's clothing more closely about them, and make their spirits bend till it is prudent to claim the rights of men and the honest freedom of speech of an englishman. how, indeed, could they venture to reprove for his vices their patron: the clergy only give the true feudal emphasis to this word. it has been observed, by men who have not superficially investigated the human heart, that / when a man makes his spirit bend to any power but reason,bit is then an affection for the whole human race that makes my pen dart rapidly along to support what i believe to be the cause of virtue: and the same motive leads me earnestly to wish to see woman placed in a station in which she would advance, instead of retarding, the progress of those glorious principles that give a substance to morality. my opinion, indeed, respecting the rights and duties of woman, seems to flow so naturally from these simplecontending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge [and virtue;] for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on / general practice. and how can woman be expected to cooperate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? if children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; butas those of man, no authority can make them discharge it in a virtuous manner. they may be convenient slaves, but slavery will have its constant effect, degrading the master and the abject dependent.besides, whilst they are only made to acquire personal accomplishments, men will seek for pleasure in variety, and faithless husbands will make faithless wives; such ignorant beings, indeed, will be very excusable when, not taught to respect public good, nor / allowed any civil rights, they attempt to do themselves justice by retaliation.the rights and duties of man thus simplified, it seems almost impertinent to attempt to illustrate truths that appear so incontrovertible; yet such deeply rooted prejudices have clouded reason, and such spurious qualities have assumed the name of virtues, that it is necessary to pursue the course of reason as it has been perplexed and involved in error, by various adventitious circumstances, comparing the simple axiom with casual deviations. men, in general, seem to employ their reason to justify prejudices, which they have imbibed, they can scarcely trace how, rather / than to root them out. the mind must be strong that resolutely forms its own principles; for a kind of intellectual cowardice prevails which makes many men shrink from the task, or only do it by halves. yet the imperfect conclusions thus drawn, areit appears to me necessary to dwell on these obvious truths, because females have been insulated, as it were; and, while they have been stripped of the virtues that should clothe / humanity, they have been decked with artificial graces that enable them to exercise a short-lived tyranny. love, in their bosoms, taking place of every nobler passion, their sole ambition is to be fair, to raise emotion instead of inspiring respect; and this ignoble desire, like the servility in absolute monarchies, destroys all strength of character. liberty is the mother of virtue, and if women [be], by their very constitution, slaves, and not allowed to breathe the sharp invigorating air of freedom, they must ever languish like exotics, and be reckoned beautiful flaws in nature[ ].let not men then in the pride of power, use the same arguments that tyrannic kings and venal ministers have used, and fallaciously assert that woman ought to be subjected because she has always been so.  but, when man, governed by reasonable laws, enjoys his natural freedom, let him despise woman, if she do not share it with him; and, till that glorious period arrives, in descanting on the folly of the sex, let him not overlook his own.discussing the advantages which a public and private education combined, as i have sketched, might rationally be expected to produce, i have dwelt most on such as are particularly relative to the female world, because i think the female world oppressed; yet the gangrene, which the vices engendered by oppression have produced, is not confined to the morbid part, but pervades society at large: so that when i wish to see my sex become more like moral agents, my heart bounds with the anticipation of the general diffusion of that sublime contentment which only morality can diffuse. /
