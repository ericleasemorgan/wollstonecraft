it is difficult for us purblind mortals to say to what height human discoveries and improvements may arrive when the gloom of despotism subsides, which makes us stumble at every step; but, when morality shall be settled on a more solid basis, then, without being gifted with a prophetic spirit, i will venture to predict that woman will be either the friend or slave of man. we shall not, as at present, doubt whether she is a moral agent, or the link which unites man with brutes. but, should it then appear, that like the brutes they were principally created for the use of man, he will let them patiently bite the bridle, and not mock them with empty praise; or, should their rationality be proved, / he will not impede their improvement merely to gratify his sensual appetites. he will not, with all the graces of rhetoric, advise them to submit implicitly their understanding to the guidance of man. he will not, when he treats of the education of women, assert that they ought never to have the free use of reason, nor would he recommend cunning and dissimulation to beings who are acquiring, in like manner as himself, the virtues of humanity.
