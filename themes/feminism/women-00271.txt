if then women are not a swarm of ephemeron triflers, why should they be kept in ignorance under the specious name of innocence? men complain, and with reason, of the follies and caprices of our sex, when they do not keenly satirize our headstrong passions and groveling vices. /  behold, i should answer, the natural effect of ignorance! the mind will ever be unstable that has only prejudices to rest on, and the current will run with destructive fury when there are no barriers to break its force. women are told from their infancy, and taught by the example of their mothers, that a little knowledge of human weakness, justly termed cunning, softness or temper, outward obedience, and a scrupulous attention to a puerile kind of propriety, will obtain for them the protection of man; and should they be beautiful, every thing else is needless, for, at least, twenty years of their lives.
