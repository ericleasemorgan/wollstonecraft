a brutal attachment to children has appeared most conspicuous in parents who have treated them like slaves, and demanded due homage for all the property they transferred to them, during their lives. it has led them to force their children to break the most sacred ties; to do violence to a natural impulse, and run into legal prostitutionb to increase wealth or shun poverty; and, still worse, the dread of parental malediction has made many weak characters violate truth in the face of heaven; and, to avoid a father's angry curse, the most sacred promises have been broken. it appears to be a natural suggestion of reason, that a man should be freed from implicit obedience to parents and private punishments, when he is of an age to be subject to the jurisdiction of the laws of his country; and that the barbarous cruelty of allowing parents to imprison their children, to prevent their contaminating their noble blood by following the / dictates of nature when they chose to marry, or for any misdemeanor that does not come under the cognizance of public justice, is one of the most arbitrary violations of liberty.c
