blackstone, to whom mr burke pays great deference,a seems to agree with dr price, that the succession of the king of great britain depends on the choice of the people, or that / they have a power to cut it off; but this power, as you have fully proved, has been cautiously exerted, and might with more propriety be termed a right than a power. be it so!  yet when you elaborately cited precedents to shew that our forefathers paid great respect to hereditary claims, you might have gone back to your favourite epoch, and shewn their respect for a church that fulminating laws have since loaded with opprobrium. the preponderance of inconsistencies, when weighed with precedents, should lessen the most bigotted veneration for antiquity, and force men / of the eighteenth century to acknowledge, that our canonized forefathers were unable, or afraid, to revert to reason, without resting on the crutch of authority; and should not be brought as a proof that their children are never to be allowed to walk alone.
